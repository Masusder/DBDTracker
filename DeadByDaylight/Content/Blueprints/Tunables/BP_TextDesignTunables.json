Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. BHVR will send its notice to your billing address (if provided) and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us. You agree to send your notice to Behaviour Digital Inc. via email to <a href=\"event:mailto:legal@bhvr.com\"><b>legal@bhvr.com</b></a>. <br /><br /><font color=\"#78acbb\"><i>C.

Waiver </i></font><br /><br />The failure of BHVR (or its licensors) to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this EULA or any BHVR Terms shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by BHVR (or its licensors) of any provision, condition or requirement of this EULA or any BHVR Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. <br /><br /><font color=\"#78acbb\"><i>E. Force Majeure. </i></font><br /><br />BHVR shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of BHVR, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond BHVR’s control such as acts of god, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. <br /><br /><font color=\"#78acbb\"><i>F.
