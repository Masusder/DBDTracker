Please enjoy today's special, Pumpkin Ghoul Pie with, may I suggest, a cup of Franken Spice Coffee while I do my best to entertain you with tonight's story. This one comes from a challenge I received from friends to tell a scary story that could go on forever. I'm not sure if it's as scary as it's gross, but it's certainly fitting for Halloween and it takes place in Medieval, Europe.  I call this one, Tiny Awful Things, but my friends are telling me I should probably call it, The Forever Horror. Have a listen and let's discuss afterwards.<br><br>There was no doubt: Lucian was a coward. He was strong and clever and fast, but a coward, nevertheless. That's what made being drafted into the king's army and marched into battle all the worse. Not wanting to put himself in harm's way, Lucian thought of a clever plan to avoid injury or even death. <br><br>As soon as the horns blared and the infantry charged into the fray, Lucian executed his cowardly plan. He let loose a war-cry like none other, rushed forward with his sword raised, then, when no one was looking, when he heard the clash of iron and the agonizing screams of dying soldiers, he made himself tumble to the ground where he played dead and hoped for the best.<br><br>Lucian was so scared that despite the stink of rotting humanity he kept his eyes closed for several days until he felt someone or something tapping his shoulder. When he opened his eyes, he found himself staring up at a man in dark robes, holding a bloody scythe. <br><br>Lucian was staring at Death. <br><br>Or, at least, that's what he thought. <br><br>Actually, it wasn't Death at all, but a lower dimensional demon making the rounds, making mischief, pretending to be Death, looking for someone, anyone, to torment. And if you know anything about lower dimensional demons you know that they absolutely delight in tormenting cowards—cowards and narcissists. <br><br>And so, this lower dimensional demon stared at Lucian with glowing red eyes and told him his time had come and asked if he had any last requests.  Lucian, of course, extended a trembling hand and begged for his life. As the demon laughed and shook its ugly head, a thought came to Lucian, and he quickly begged for one last meal. <br><br>The demon stepped back, smiled, and said he would entertain his last request. He told him he would allow him to live for as much time it would take for him to fill his belly with whatever he could find on this battlefield… no… not battlefield… buffet… this buffet of death. <br><br>Lucian didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to eat. He wasn't a cannibal, and he certainly didn't want to commit any kind of sin before dying. He was about to surrender to his fate when he felt something squirm by his hand. He looked down and that's when he saw the… tiny, awful things… squirming out of the bloated belly of a corpse… falling on his hand. <br><br>Desperate, Lucian did the unthinkable. With a miserable sigh, he plunged his hand into the rotting belly, felt around the stinking, oozing innards and soon pulled out a dangling white maggot. <br><br>Swallowing a thickness in his throat, he held the tiny, awful thing up in the moonlight, then opened his mouth and let the maggot plop onto his tongue.  \nThe demon winced in disgust, laughed in disbelief, then said some words in a strange, unknown language. <br><br>Lucian didn't understand any of it, but he thought he might have been cursed as he strangely began to feel a great insatiable hunger for maggots.  More than this, he even began savoring them as one might savor a fine wine or coffee, enjoying, to his disbelief, the aftertaste. <br><br>I guess we can say that as a coffee bean soaks up the essence of the tree and land it grows upon, a maggot soaks up the essence of the corpse it feeds upon. <br><br>The demon smiled at Lucian as he desperately tried to delay the inevitable. When Lucian finally finished savoring the maggot, the demon told him his time was up. <br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been crushed by a club.  Blood and gore spilled out of the eye sockets like spaghetti and meatballs. And there in the spaghetti and meatballs tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his greedy, salivating, tongue. <br><br>Robust. Earthy. Slimy. A velvety maggot that bursts with herbal notes and soothes with its fresh and bold character. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up. <br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been diced into small pieces by an ax. Chunks of bone and intestine festered in pools of blood like stew. And there in the stew tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue. <br><br>Bold, yet fruity. Chewy. A sweet maggot with delicate hints of citrus. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up. <br><br>Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been trampled by horses and marching soldiers. Pieces of skull and brain fermented in bile and blood like a delicious dipping sauce for veggies. And there in the dipping sauce tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue. <br><br>Herbal. Intense. Mushy. A full-bodied maggot rich in flavor. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up…and as you can imagine the story goes on and on cause the demon enjoyed watching this coward grovel like a maggot for his life. And since it goes on and on, I would appreciate some help telling it… at least until we run out of tiny, awful things. <br><br>Please pass this bowl of putrid guts and gore around the Moonstone. I invite you to reach inside and choose a tiny, awful thing to savor. <br><br>Please feel free to describe its flavors and let's not spare any gory, juicy, mushy details. <br><br>Okay, okay. I confess… They aren't real maggots, but slimy, sugary things soaking in warm brandy and pumpkin guts… but let's stick our hands in anyway and have a little fun to help us get into the spirit of Halloween.  \n",

I think it's a little bit of both. This one comes from the grains I observed at the bottom of my espresso cup a few days ago. It kind of resembled a bell… and so I'm calling this one… The Bell from Hell. <br><br>Toby and his sister Tina were always up to no good, and this time they snuck into the old, overgrown junkyard that many claimed was haunted. Despite the rumors, the teens played in the rusty wrecks, honking horns, kicking windshields, and, of course, scaring each other to hell. <br><br>'It's fun here!'' Toby said. <br><br>'It is!'' Tina agreed. <br><br>As the night wore on Toby hid in the trunk of an old sedan with the intention of scaring his sister. But Tina followed a trail he unwittingly left and— <br><br>RRRAAH! <br><br>Scared him instead! <br><br>Toby cursed, and Tina ran off promising she would get him, again. She quickly rushed to the old compactor and hid in a half-squashed station wagon filled with a strange, black fog. That's odd, she thought, and didn't think any more of it. <br><br>But she probably should have thought a little more of it since strange, black fog isn't exactly an omen as you know from my previous stories.  Anyhow, Tina waited patiently in the backseat. When an hour passed, she began to worry. Slowly, she craned her head to peak out the window when—<br><br>RRRAAH! <br><br>Toby slammed the station! <br><br>Tina nearly jumped out of her skin, hitting her head against the ceiling of the half-crumpled car. Toby couldn't help but laugh, and as he laughed, he looked down into the churning, black fog and saw—<br><br>A bell. <br><br>A strange-looking, iron bell unlike any bell he had ever seen before. <br><br>''Will you look at this, '' he said, holding up the bell, examining the craftsmanship. Then he grabbed a stick from the ground and clanged the bell stupidly. <br><br>CLANG. CLANG. CLANG. <br><br>The ominous ring echoed through the abandoned junkyard as the black fog thickened and swirled around them. But before they could say anything about the strange fog—<br><br>The compactor came to life! <br><br>WHIRRRRRR! <br><br>Tina felt her heart fall into the pit of her stomach, and she screamed in horror! <br><br>Toby dropped the bell, grabbed her hands and yanked her out just in time. Breathlessly, they watched the station wagon as it creaked and groaned and shattered into scrap. <br><br>There was a long, tense silence as they wondered what had given sudden power to the otherwise rusted and broken compactor. Just then, the bell rang, again. This time behind them. Tina exchanged a look with Toby and swallowed a growing thickness in her throat. They turned slowly to face—<br><br>Nothing. <br><br>Absolutely, nothing. <br><br>Nothing but the swirling fog. <br><br>It was probably just their imaginations. <br><br>Or was it… <br><br>For just as they released a collective sigh, the bell rang once again, and something suddenly materialized out of the fog. Within moments, they were face to face with a—<br><br>Wraith! <br><br>The Wraith instantly grabbed Toby by the neck with one arm and lifted him high in the silvery moonlight, his feet dangling, his arms flailing, his lips quivering with fear. <br><br>Tina gasped and stumbled back to her haunches. The Wraith smashed Toby against the ground with a powerful thud. He raised a rusted, wheel wrench and proceeded to bludgeon his head to scrap, blood and gore splattering everywhere. <br><br>Then the Wraith turned to face Tina with his creepy bell and dead eyes. Covered in her brother's warm blood, Tina screamed until her lungs gave out and waited… for the bell to toll. <br><br>Now what the siblings didn't realize was that they had entered a kind of dimensional pocket that had brought them to another world.  See, there are these pockets or holes in the world that lead to all kinds of dark places… places that defy reality… dark places that make all our combined depictions of hell seem like a flower garden.  But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just say that for Toby and Tina death was not an escape.",
    "3AC8CFEA484275C948B4399CD66DEFF8": "<b>Stories from the Witch Café. Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone Café!  Tonight, seeing as we just made a batch of Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake to go with our famous Halloween Latte, I thought a story about pumpkins might be fitting. This story was told long ago in a village that once stood very close to where we all stand now, and I call this one, Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.<br><br>The widow's name was Ulla and more than anything she wanted to win the annual pumpkin festival. Not just for the prize money, but to impress her six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who loved everything about pumpkins. Their texture. Their shape. Their color. Their smell. Everything.<br><br>But Ulla's pumpkins were nothing compared to her neighbor's pumpkins. Her neighbor Mona won the pumpkin festival every year, and she seemed to have a secret for growing perfect pumpkins. <br><br>That's not to say, Ulla's pumpkins were bad. They weren't. They just weren't very special. At best, they had been described by the great pumpkin judges as average. Average height.  Average width. Average color.  Average smell. Average.  \nAnd average didn't win awards. <br><br>Well, not wanting to be average anymore, Ulla decided she needed to know Mona's secret. So, one morning she waited until Mona left for the market, and when she knew the coast was clear, she did the unthinkable. She snuck into her house. <br><br>To Ulla's amazement the kitchen was filled with glass jars containing pumpkin seeds of every variety. Each jar had a label that included a name, instructions, and some very peculiar symbols.   \nReading the labels, Ulla felt a cold shiver run through her body. She couldn't make sense of the names or symbols and for a moment, just a moment, she suspected witchcraft. <br><br>Part of her wanted to run, but the other part—the part that hated to lose—wanted a little help, a little boost, a fighting chance to win the festival and make her daughter proud. <br><br>Ignoring her better instinct to run, Ulla found a jar labeled: Mortafykuss Cucurruss. She scrutinized the label and read that these seeds would produce the biggest and brightest pumpkins but that they were still quite unstable. The seeds were unstable. Ulla winced, and she had no idea what that meant or how pumpkin seeds could be unstable. She continued to read a warning—<br><br>No blood. Especially at night. <br><br>She laughed out loud. Who in their right mind would feed a plant blood? Who would heed such a warning? And for a moment she really thought that maybe, just maybe, Mona was a witch, a powerful witch who could defy nature and modify and mutate seeds. <br><br>Despite the creepy warnings, Ulla borrowed one seed--just one-- from the Mortafykuss Cucurruss jar, convincing herself that she would give Mona back a seed from her winning pumpkin. With that promise, she convinced herself she wasn't stealing, and she quickly returned to her small, humble farm. <br><br>No sooner did Ulla return home than she planted the seed in her garden. To her amazement there was a visible pumpkin growing the very next day, and every day after that more pumpkins appeared linked to a thorny, green vine unlike anything she had ever seen before. <br><br>Well, to be sure, Rebecca jumped up and down with joy at the sight of the massive pumpkins. She couldn't stop hugging and measuring and sniffing the pumpkins. <br><br>When the time came, Ulla told Rebecca to choose a pumpkin for the festival, and as she selected the choicest pumpkin from the patch, she got so excited that she tumbled into the thick, green vines and cut herself against the thorns. The vines and pumpkins trembled momentarily with sudden life. <br><br>Ulla dismissed the sudden movement as the wind and proceeded to dress her daughter's wounds. Then she placed the chosen pumpkin on a wheelbarrow and pushed it to the market to face the judges of the great, big pumpkin festival. <br><br>It didn't take long to declare Ulla the winner. And Rebecca jumped up and down, and she screamed and celebrated that they had finally won the festival. <br><br>Ulla reveled in her daughter's joy and felt a great surge of pride. <br><br>But that joy was short-lived when Mona suddenly emerged from the crowd admiring the winning pumpkin and sniffing it as though searching for a signature scent. A tell-tale. Proof that Ulla had stolen one of her seeds. Then she put her ear to the pumpkin and locked eyes with Ulla. For a moment, it seemed as though she wanted to say something. But then, Mona smiled, gave the pumpkin a gentle caress, and walked away. <br><br>Ulla watched Mona until she disappeared, and she told herself she would gut her winning pumpkin and return a seed back to Mona just as soon as she returned home. <br><br>And so, with exhausted arms, Ulla wheelbarrowed her pumpkin down the dirt road with her daughter singing and skipping behind her in the moonlight. Caught up in the euphoria of winning, Ulla tried to skip with her daughter, but she missed a beat and twisted her foot on a stone. <br><br>Ulla stumbled forward, lost control of the wheelbarrow and the great, big pumpkin tumbled out, smashing against a massive stone. <br><br>Suddenly, mother and daughter froze in terror! <br><br>Thick, orange liquid like blood poured out of the busted pumpkin. Through the cracks they could see something moving… something… breathing… <br><br>Ulla approached the pumpkin slowly. She hesitated, then placed her fingers in the pulpy crack and pulled and pulled and—<br><br>WHAAAAH! <br><br>A pumpkin baby burst out! <br><br>And attached itself to her face! <br><br>Pulp dripping down her face and back, Ulla ripped the pumpkin baby off her face and smashed it repeatedly against the ground as it wailed and screamed and finally died. Then she dropped the limp, pulpy corpse in the grass and watched it melt into a thick, orange puddle of steaming, pumpkin puss. <br><br>Ulla grabbed her daughter by the hand and rushed home. But when they reached home… the whole farm had been overrun by gigantic, bright orange pumpkins and thick vines with thorns like knives. <br><br>Wanting to burn the pumpkin patch down, Ulla held her daughter close, and she led her to the shed as the vines trembled, slithered and brushed by their feet. Then, all at once, the vines coiled around their ankles and—<br><br>WHAAAAP! <br><br>Mother and daughter hit the ground as throbbing vines wrapped around them like hungry snakes. <br><br>Ulla stared in horror as massive pumpkins seemed to suddenly hatch like giant orange eggs in the moonlight. From those pumpkins came creatures staggering on two legs with long, clumsy vines for arms. <br><br>And as these killer pumpkins closed in on Ulla, she noticed they had orange and green skin and thick thorns for feet, and… the faces… they… resembled… her daughter. <br><br>Before she could make sense of what she was seeing, an evil vine coiled around her neck and head and thirsty thorns pierced her skin and gorged on her blood as hundreds of newborn pumpkin monsters wailed at the moon and a cold darkness swept over her. <br><br>As for the younglings… they grew and multiplied and went on a murderous rampage throughout the town. But, rest assured, they were finally stopped by a few good witches with some pretty powerful spells. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just agree that we shouldn't mess around with pumpkin seeds and that we prefer to eat our pumpkins than be eaten by them.\n",

Only inside this tower, instead of stories and Irish wine, they found dozens of flayed bodies and leather scrolls covered in tattoos. The tattooed messages and symbols are indecipherable. Could be messages and secrets about this dark dimension. Things learned. Things discovered. Perhaps even a way out of this infernal prison. ",

But the survivor’s attempt had been marred by the three Watchers who had somehow entered the minds of the prisoners. Through memories, visions, and dreams, they had been made to believe harnessing dark energy was their only chance to escape. That the devices would somehow open a doorway back home. But the cloaked survivor knew better. The cloaked survivor could see the dark energy was doing something else to the world and that the Watchers had something far more wicked in mind. ",

A few of us found more of these scrolls and strange instruments like the glowing blue contraption in the basement. The symbols on the scrolls seem very familiar to those found within the pages of Sam Park’s codex. Several of these ancient scrolls were returned to the House of Arkham, and upon further inspection, it was clear that the scrolls were made out of human skin and that someone had been hunting people with arcane symbols tattooed on their bodies. Strange yet fascinating to think that there are human ‘books’ walking around the realm with secret knowledge that could possibly help us better understand this loveless inferno. Could make for an interesting character in the moving picture I will eventually write, produce and direct. I imagine a character recording the secrets of the universe on his skin with cosmic ink that cannot be erased, smudged, or destroyed. But, in reality, he’s probably some ordinary Joe from a strange world who tattooed a grocery list on his body. Curious to learn more about these ‘human books,’ I spent time researching the Chamber of Blood for stories inspired by or referencing a character like him. No luck yet, though I did find one story about strange instruments attached to hooks and generators that could open a portal out of a hellish world not unlike this one. Could be our ticket out of here. I’ll keep digging.",

Story-Hook is a term used by high-school English teachers. Rose laughs. Yes, but Lazar's an idiot and he wants to feel like he created his own theory for his upcoming book. Dwight's eyes go wide. Book? What book? Rose laughs absurdly and explains. An autobiographic book. A guaranteed bestseller highlighting Lazar's new theory on creativity. But Lazar hasn't done anything yet. It's all smoke and mirrors. Rose laughs and corrects him. He's done one thing really well… He's burned through millions. Rose changes the subject and tells Dwight he needs to meet Lazar's ghostwriter for an interview. Make sure to shower praises about our naked emperor for his autobiography.",

Five years and Peak 22 has nothing. Rose smirks. Correction. Five years and we almost have Lazar's biography and his theory on creativity.",

Lisa shrugs, disagrees, but doesn’t want to get into it with her friend—her annoying friend. She likes his books, the way his style allows her to live in his character’s head for a little while. She finds his novel about an artist to be a fun, formless, dream-like stew with plenty of style and substance. But what does she know, she’s only sixteen, and her English marks are below average. Pam hoots and hollers, and with a mischievous smile, she reveals a hand covered with ink-smudged, symbols. Best luck in the world! No test! No lard ass! No dead authors for the rest of the year! Thanks, Lisa! Lisa stares at the symbols on her hand and wants to yell at her for being so careless with things they both don’t fully understand. She closes her eyes and hopes her English teacher wants to be dead and that he isn’t lurking about.",

Pam snaps Lisa out of her thoughts with another tactless comment. Lisa hears her grandmother’s voice in her head telling her that her friend has tempted fate by laughing at someone else’s misfortune. For having laughed at the dead. She doesn’t really believe in all her grandmother’s superstitions… and yet… she inches away from her friend, staring at the darkening clouds, waiting for lightning to strike Pam down.",

She saw something she liked, asked Meg to run, and now she wants her to race at the State Championships. From a virtual nobody to glorified jock almost overnight. New friends, bitter rivals and rumors abound. Why Meg? Why does she get a free ticket?  She never practiced, sucked up, or took diet pills to keep her weight in check. Why her? What makes her so special? The idea of a free ticket makes Meg laugh. No free ticket for her. She’s always loved to run, just not in an organized way, and she’s quite certain she put more hours into her passion than anyone else on the team.  \n\nThe team dresses Meg up in bandit costume with black and white stripes like a criminal in a silent film. It’s so stupid she wants to scream. Two team members argue over the costume and finally decide on dropping the cliché bandit look for a more contemporary supervillain costume.  They make a mask and tell her to slash tires near the police station. Then they exchange anxious looks with one another. Sounds less like initiation and more like a way to get her off the team and into a prison cell. Dana gives her a strange look, a dirty look. Seems like she has an upset stomach, gas even. She hates Meg for beating her time and probably wants to see her locked up. The rest of the team thinks up supervillain names for Meg. Street Rusher. Super Blaster. Dare Diva. Whatever.

She kneels behind a cruiser, hesitates, her hand trembles involuntarily. She’s not used to breaking the law. She takes a deep, calming breath. First time for anything. Then, with a pocketknife, she slashes a tire, yanks a piece of rubber off and backs away. Before the officers realize what’s what Meg’s a bolt of lightning. Her heart’s pounding in her throat. Her legs are a blur. The police give chase but eat her dust. She returns to the team with a piece of slashed rubber and a new team record. A police cruiser. An actual police cruiser. Beat that!

He vaults to his feet and searches for his new friends. He finds one… pieces of one… of another… he’s not sure. He hears someone moaning. He searches and finds… Funanya… not dead but dying… sliced at every tendon… writhing in agony… covered in something golden… honey… they poured honey over her… and a million tiny black things swim, drown, and gorge on the gold and crimson streams dripping from her open wounds.  \n\nThe ants are crawling under her skin and eating her alive. He kneels beside her and tries to swap them away but it’s no use. They’re everywhere. Funanya whimpers and sputters blood as she tries to speak. But her tongue is missing and all that issues is a terrible, rattling noise. Philip kneels before her. He doesn’t know what to say or do. I fell asleep… I’m sorry… so sorry… but sorry doesn’t put her back together again. Sorry doesn’t get rid of the ants or bring back the children she was protecting. She barely scratches something with her finger in the dirt. I forgive.  \n\nPhilip stares at the words for a long moment. Silent tears fall as he raises his hand in front her face. She closes her eyes and waits for her suffering to end. He doesn’t want to do it, but he has to. He knows he has to. He closes his eyes and lowers his hand over her mouth and nose, and for a moment, just a moment, he becomes her angel of mercy.  ",

Maybe the very ones who killed his grandmother… his parents. No hell is good enough for these demons who would take money to disappear people. They’re cooking something by a fire, laughing, and making jokes at the expense of those they butchered. They talk about his people as though they were animals. No. Less than animals. No one takes pride or ridicules the animals they slaughter. He’s never seen anything like it. Dogs without humanity, that’s what they are, dogs, rabid dogs, nothing less, nothing more. Something ancient tugs at him. He feels darkness like a tendril from another world take hold of his young, innocent heart. Not young or innocent, anymore. He hears Funanya’s voice. Forgive, and be forgiven.  \n\nBut he doesn’t want to forgive and he doesn’t want to be forgiven. He wants them to suffer like they made his people suffer. He wants them to suffer for taking everything from him. He hears his grandmother’s voice trying to distract him from his dark thoughts of revenge with infinite math problems. But over her voice is the raging, maddening heartbeat of his hate. Her voice screams out equations and challenges. But he glares at the men. He feels kerosene coursing through his veins and he’s ready to explode. An eye for an eye and the whole world plunges into infinite night. Good.   \n\nPhilip notices the guns by the jeep. He could grab one and shoot them all. But he’s never used a gun and they’d probably run away. He could find a knife or machete… but these dogs would overpower him… Just walk away, Philip. Never look back. It’s your duty to survive and bear witness. He ignores the voices in his head and only wants one thing. He wants them to suffer and disappear. He wants to… yes… take their kerosene and make them disappear the same way they made his friends and family disappear--in a swirl of smoke. And for a moment… just a moment… he is the angel of death swooping through infinite night.  ",

What's Casey gotten herself into this time? You know Casey, probably some save-the-bees organization that just doesn't understand the way the world works. No such thing as the American Dream anymore, only the Corporate Dream and the Corporate Dream and the American Dream ain't the same thing. She's read about The Narrows… supposed to be the poorest and most polluted district in Falls City.  Maybe it's because it's the poorest that it's also the most polluted. Maybe it's because of corrupt yet legal policy against those who can't afford the big lawyers to change or challenge the corrupt policy. Paper mills. Car factories. Toxic waste facilities. All dumping on the land and water. A few politicians set the dollar price to poison the environment and an entire community of blue-collar workers pay the price, the ultimate price, with their health and lives. Nothing new. Same old, same old. The fat-cats and bureaucrats keep doing it because they can. So long as there's money to be made in poisoning the world, someone will be there to make it. That's everywhere, every city she ever read about, and Falls City ain't no exception. She used to care, but then there was too much to care about, and so she decided it was easier not to care anymore. Funny how that happened. All she cares about now is skateboarding and finding the impossible place to tag. Whatever, maybe she'll find something to tag in The Narrows. She skates down the street following Upper Falls River toward the poorest and most polluted district in Falls City.",

But have you looked at his family name? That will explain everything.<br><br>Sally wills herself to think of a gentle lake, lilies and—no… all she can see are the grimy asylum walls and bloody bandages. There are no gentle breezes to distract her, only the Broken Woman's voice prodding deeper. Did you not have a husband, sweet nurse? I recall the newspaper article… hand to heart, my dear, I cried at his unfortunate death. You would have had beautiful babies. To now be here, a widow of pure genes, serving the filth of the world—such a turn of events.<br><br>Sally gets up, leaving a bandage half-wrapped. Her feet shuffle imprecisely as she moves for the door. She tries to push her thoughts away, knows she shouldn't think it, but—it is such cruelty. Her love was pure, her husband pure, and those who live in these halls are anything but. Yet these sick, twisted beasts, receive the care and attention deserved to the man she lost.<br><br>Her throat catches on each breath. Her vision blurs. She wants to run but knows it's no use. No matter where she goes, she always finds herself back in these halls. With swirling thoughts, one stark realization breaks through: it is not she who keeps the insane confined to these halls, but the insane who confine her.<br><br>She falls to the unforgiving floor. ",

We decoded a few other stories and came to the conclusion that these people were sending encrypted locations of places where they believe there would be ghosts. We didn't buy any of that paranormal crap and we were just having fun drinking and decoding the stories and looking up the places on satellite maps. But when the coordinates of one story turned out to be close to us, we thought we could check out the place for fun. Adrien rented a car and we headed up to what was left of the crumbling asylum. There was nothing but overgrown ruins. But I remember this unnatural black fog and it was like we were at the asylum but some other version of it. It was really strange. And that's when we saw this thing… this giant samurai with a demon mask lurking about as though it had stepped out of one world and into another. He killed Mia first.

She remembered the whispers, the approaching darkness, and the sense that somehow they were in another reality. She didn't remember much about that time, but she remembered being taken in by her French-Canadian godparents, the Rois, who raised her with their son, Jordan. \n\nNow Haddie and her older stepbrother Jordan were in India, filming episodes for their fairly successful web series 'Harbinger of Hell' with their uncle Stefan. A fan had sought them out after having watched one of their episodes about interdimensional overlaps which Haddie could sense, feel and even explore if her focus was right and she was able to 'tune in' as she so often described her process.  \n\nAs their luck would have it this mysterious benefactor had funded an entire expedition all over the world, giving her brother and uncle access to countless remote and classified areas of known paranormal activity and unexplainable disappearances. \n\nHaddie sipped her tea, listening to the villagers speak a language that reminded her of her disappeared father, and she suddenly heard a familiar voice and Quebecois accent that stood out from the rest calling out her name.  \n\nA moment later Stefan entered the dhaba with Jordan. “I found the site of the massacre,” Stefan said. “Finish your tea, and let's get outta here!”  \n\nHaddie sprang to her feet and followed her uncle and brother into the scorching hot day.",

Nothing here but the eyes, and they're probably watching us right now.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan didn't answer or want to explain that their uncle didn't have the stomach for adventure, that he was more of a producer and that he was trying to finish off a horror novel he'd been working on for the last ten years. Ignoring the guide's nervous ramblings, Haddie studied the white stone bricks of the ruined fort and the surrounding caves with a strange feeling that they were being watched.  \n\nThe guide said, “The official story is a unit of British soldiers died fighting a band of thugees.”   \n\n“And the unofficial story?” Haddie turned to him.

Something in these caves drove them mad.”  \n\nHaddie absorbed this and closed her eyes while Jordan filmed the ruins and the caves.

It's my day to make rotis and pick up the kids from school.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan watched the guide disappear down the rocky, sun-baked valley.

She didn't recognize her captors but it wasn't the first time someone had forced her to find something with her special abilities.  \n\nHaddie followed a trail of residual memories—memories and whispers only she could see and hear.

The creature then snatched the thug and dragged him screaming through a series of interconnecting tunnels. She chased after the fading memory, entering a small cavern as she watched the thug release the relic as the creature dragged him into a smaller tunnel that she imagined led to a feeding den.   \n\nMemories burned out like dying embers to reveal a cavern of human bones piled over thick rotting sludge. She winced at the stench of fermented organs and fluids and waved a cloud of flies away from her face. Near one pile of bones was a corpse, still warm, flayed from head to toe, eyes missing, mouth transfixed in an agonizing scream. The captors stared at the corpse for a long moment before one prodded Haddie with the barrel of his rifle. \n\n “What the hell did this?” One of their captors murmured in disbelief.  \n\n“There must be a bend in reality here.” Another captor offered as an explanation. Haddie noted that what she called an 'overlap' these men called a 'bend.' It was clear that they had an understanding of other dimensions and that somehow this piece of column was more than just a relic. \n\n“Where is it?” The leader prodded Haddie. “Where's the relic!” \n\nHaddie took a moment, then pointed at a pile of bones. “But it could also be in there…” She motioned toward the tunnel that led to the feeding den.  \n\n“Check the bones,” one captor ordered the siblings.    \n\nJordan and Haddie kneeled in the sticky sludge and rummaged through the bones as the leader turned toward the shadowy tunnel.  He inched close to the opening and flashed a blade of light inside. While the other two captors were dealing with flies and covering their noses, Haddie found the jagged piece of column and stealthily slid it over to Jordan.  \n\nA sudden chatter of teeth and hissing made them all turn to the leader. He searched the darkness with a beam of light that suddenly momentary revealed a grotesque creature with a face covered by dozens if not hundreds of glowing red eyes.  \n\nThe leader brought the beam back to the face as the creature hissed and revealed a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. An instant later the creature grabbed the flashlight and pulled the leader inside the den.  \n\nThe other captors stumbled, dropped things and fired stupidly into the darkness. Haddie instantly grabbed a fallen flashlight, looked at her brother with wide, desperate eyes and yelled for him to— \n\n“RUN!” ",

The creature shrieked something terrible.   \n\nHaddie seized the opportunity to severe the head but the creature lunged away and the blade hit the stone wall. The kukri vibrated out of her hand and she dove to the ground as the creature charged her.  \n\nTumbling away, Haddie instinctively grabbed a slab of stone. The creature attacked and missed, hitting the wall. Without hesitation Haddie smashed the slab over its bewildered head with a terrible crunching sound she wouldn't soon forget.  \n\nThe creature collapsed and Haddie, adrenalin rushing, bludgeoned the head and eyes. When there was nothing left but a sticky, warm pulp she released the gore-covered stone and fell back on her haunches to gather herself. But no sooner did she relax than she heard the rising crescendo of chattering teeth echoing through the darkness.  \n\nWith an almost defeated sigh, Haddie staggered to her feet. White fear flashed through her mind as the chattering and hissing grew louder and louder. Teeth clenched as thousands of red eyes flared up in the inky blackness of the cave.

In her mind's eye she saw cloaked figures hiding pieces of the same pillar in another world. She shrugged and kept what she had seen to herself. Then she pulled out her cellphone and handed it to Jordan. He centered her in the frame and indicated he was filming.   \n\nHaddie cleared her throat, mopped her forehead of sweat and soot, looked into the lens, and proceeded to address her online followers:  \n\n“My name is Haddie and I was born with a wonderful curse.

What happened to these soldiers? Where did they disappear to? And is there any merit to the accounts of a cave-dwelling demon with eyes around its head that burn right through the soul?” \n\nHaddie stared meditatively into the camera and wanted to say 'yes' to every one of her questions but decided it was better to leave them up to interpretation.

Why was it chasing me? Misato nods. The Oni could mean you're struggling to maintain your humanity as you chase your dreams, that you may be torn between right and wrong, between good and evil. Misato laughs to herself as she finishes her beer.  Maybe winning isn' t everything. Maybe you're greedy. Maybe you're trying to swallow an ocean when a glass of water would suffice. Yui scoffs. Greedy? I'm broke and you're paying for the beers! Misato shakes a drunken finger at her. Greed isn't just about money, Yui. It's about wanting more of anything.  More races. More trophies. More fame. Maybe your need to prove yourself is killing something in you that doesn't want to die. Yui sighs and downs her beer. Enough stupid talk and more drinking. Behind her dismissive smile Yui believes her nightmare has nothing to do with ego or greed, but the anxiety of not having the money to pursue her dream. ",

Empathy is what makes us human and if you lose this you are… you are just a very good machine that wins. What does it matter if you gain the world if you lose your humanity?

He remembers his gut churning, twisting, fighting against the weight of his eyelids, trying his best to keep them open as bloody hell erupted all around him.

So much to read… and yet I find myself drawn to the scribblings and renditions of the unknown creator I'm calling the Mad Designer. Journals filled with the wild sketches and musings of people I imagine are caught in other parts of this living dimension--people juxtaposed with other Terra worlds and timelines that make little or no sense to who they are or where they come from. The illustrations and notes are foolish, absurd and quite contradictory, and yet they bring moments of levity to my life which does the soul good. I suppose it's a form of absurd escapism I turn to when I'm not reading the more traditional stories. Interestingly enough, I found seventeen versions of a story featuring a killer named Evan written by seventeen versions of the same author from the omniverse. Seventeen similar stories with sometimes subtle, sometimes significant differences. What I find particularly interesting is how the stories are written as fiction in one world and non-fiction in another. It reminds me of Universus Alveo… a theory that suggests that the human mind might very well be equipped with a powerful networking mechanism that reaches out to other worlds for wisdom and knowledge from our other-selves. Some can use their minds in this way and others can't. The theory suggests that those who have experienced trauma in their formative years detach from their reality, allowing them to explore other realities and worlds with relative ease. Artists like magicians and shamans see small things in the big, unexplainable endless dream that is the omniverse and they bring these ideas or insights back to entertain, enlighten and inspire the world. Fiction in one world, non-fiction in another. Everything is real, or nothing is. And here in the Chamber of Blood there are countless horror stories of every variety.  So many that it seems to me that one of the unknown prisoners was collecting these stories as a way to discover more about their imprisonment, the Entity and the terrible screams coming from the surrounding abyss. Whether this true or not, I'm not sure, but what I do know is I spent the whole night reading my favorite stories out loud like my father used to do by the fireplace. And the entire time I couldn't help but wonder… How?  How could anyone have accessed and assembled such a rich collection of notes, journals and stories? I have no immediate answer, but I suspect by the texture and density of the fog that I may be in a place as complex, mysterious and misunderstood as a black hole—a living, breathing, all-consuming black hole, the serpent of infinity that gorges on its tail, that eats itself endlessly as it spirals downward into the cosmic, Fibonacci stew that is life incomprehensible.",

But his niece and nephew, who had tougher nerves for the macabre.  \n\nStefan much preferred a safe and cozy hotel room where he could raid the mini-bar and see to the logistics of the show.  It wasn't that he didn't like adventure. It was more that he didn't like graves, tombs or places that felt dark, creepy and dangerous.  Haddie had once suggested that he wrote horror stories as a kind of therapy to work out his fears and anxieties of the unknown. She was half right. The other half was that he simply liked to be alone—alone with all the characters and voices chattering in his head, voices that demanded to be heard and set to paper.  \n\nNow the voices were compelling him to write a vampire story. Their benefactor claimed that there had been a village of real vampires in ancient Anatolia that had been hidden from the rest of the world. According to the intelligence provided, vampires weren't fictional monsters but actual intra-dimensional creatures that had once tried to overrun the world. They had been defeated by an unknown group of mystical warriors. Somehow the few creatures that had survived managed to erase themselves from history by warping and weaving whatever memory of them was left into exaggerated myths and legends.  \n\nStefan found this theory of myths and legends and parallel worlds interesting if not intriguing.  \n\nVampires real.  \n\nActually, real.  \n\nNothing like the movies, but real nevertheless.  \n\nOne theory he had just finished reading online suggested that everything created or imagined existed somewhere in the 'Garden of Infinity.'  In other words, stories and characters came from a real place in the infinite landscape that was the omniverse.  \n\nThe theory went on to suggest that artists had somehow unlocked their third eye and were able to see into other realities.  An idea, a vision, or a dream, according to the theory, was the pineal gland seeing into the infinite for truth, wisdom, inspiration. The brain, then, was a quantum computer that could network with the infinite. It was a nice idea. It meant that his most cherished characters from his favorite books… were somehow… somewhere… real. A sudden knock at the door startled him out of his quantum musings.  \n\n\"Mr. Roi… Your lunch is ready.\"  \n\nLunchtime already and Stefan still didn't have his story. He rose lazily in his bathrobe, hoping Jordan and Haddie had better luck finding the unmarked graves they had set out to find. He imagined his niece and nephew were enjoying the sun while filming the ruins and enjoying the peanut butter and banana sandwiches he had prepared for them.",

Beneath the Ruins 2.<br><br>\"Move away from the casket!\" A middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes dressed in a black suit pointed a revolver at Haddie and Jordan. Haddie dropped her shovel, sighed, exchange a look with her brother and stepped away from the bolted casket.   \n\n\"Who do you work for?\" Haddie asked, eying the woman.  \n\n\"That, my dear, does not concern you.\" \n\nJordan shook his head. \"I don't think you should open it.\"  \n\n\"Shut-up!\"  \n\n\"My brother's right.\" Haddie pointed at the symbols etched all in the rotten wood of the casket. \"It's a warning of some kind… whatever's in there… is meant to stay in there.\"  She scrutinized the half-crescent and three dots and wondered what they meant. They didn't resemble any of the other symbols she had come across in the last few months.  \n\n\"Superstitious nonsense!\" The woman yelled, aimed the revolver at the bolt and pulled the trigger. A report echoed through the ruins and the surrounding forest. \n\nHaddie wondered if their guide and translator had heard them. He probably didn't even take notice or didn't care. He refused to follow them near the tombs, called them ignorant tourists, and said he would stay by the car texting his friends until they returned. The woman pulled the trigger repeatedly until the bolt clanged off and hit the ground with a thud.  \n\n\"I hope he calls the police,\" Jordan whispered to Haddie.  \n\n\"I wouldn't count on it…\"  \n\nThe woman examined the casket carefully. Haddie and Jordan inched backward as she struggled to yank the lid open. As Haddie cautiously backed away, she figured the woman worked for the same secret society that had now interfered with several of her investigations.  \n\nShe didn't know much about them, but from what she had gathered by overhearing a few of their goons in Egypt was that they were searching for hidden knowledge—knowledge they believed would help humanity transcend to another plane of existence.   \n\n\"Please…\" Haddie cautioned. \"Don't open it until we know what the symbol means.\"  \n\nThe goon scoffed and, with a labored scream, yanked the lid open to reveal— \n\nNothing.  \n\nNothing but a strange black mist.  \n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. \"It's supposed to be here… the book…\"   \n\nThe goon's eyes narrowed. Frustration creased her face as black mist suddenly rose and spiralled into her mouth and nose as though it were alive.  \n\nHaddie and Jordan stepped out of the grave. \n\nThe woman gagged, coughed and collapsed. There in the dirt, she jerked and twitched in all kinds of unnatural directions, screaming and shrieking as the mist reshaped her body into something indescribably grotesque. Her veins stood out thick and black in her neck. Her hands smashed the ground, and she went into hysteric convulsions as though being burned alive.  Then, with a blood-curdling scream, her body went limp and silent. \n\nHaddie repressed a cry of horror. She felt a cold prickle run down her spine as she stared at the scene in disbelief. What was going on? What strange mist could do such a thing to a person?  Was it some kind of ancient poison… some kind of toxic vapor… or was it something worse…  \n\n\"Well… you don't see that every day, do you?\" Jordan said flatly. \"I seriously wish I got that on my phone.\"  \n\nHaddie sighed. \"Is she dead?\" \n\n\"Dead as a tomb.\"  \n\nHaddie didn't find him funny. Not in the least. He was scared. She could tell by his desperate attempt to use humor to hide his fear. He was just about to crack another joke when the creature suddenly twitched back to life.  \n\nStartled, Haddie gasped and pulled at Jordan's t-shirt, saying, \"We need to get out of here.\" But just as she stepped back, the creature turned to face them with blood-red eyes and a jaw protruding like a snout with teeth that seemed to be growing underneath stretched skin.  \n\n\"Oh shit!\" Haddie blurted. She lost her footing, and fell to the ground with her brother.  The creature that had once been a woman roared at them, revealing two massive fangs like carving knives.",

Beneath the Ruins 3.<br><br>\"This way!\" Haddie yelled, leading Jordan through the shadow and light spilling through the forest canopy. She could hear the creature shrieking as it hunted them with unnatural speed and resolve. Spotting an outcrop of jagged rocks, she quickly yanked her brother into hiding.  \n\n\"Aren't vampires supposed to explode in sunlight?\" Jordan asked.  \"I mean, isn't that what's supposed to happen!? Doesn't it know it's supposed to be dead?\"  \n\nHaddie instantly placed a finger by his quivering lips as she heard footfalls approaching. She repressed an urge to look at the creature. Instead, she listened. She could hear the clattering and hissing coming from its hungry jaws. She could hear the crunch of stones and the distinct snap of twigs as the creature searched for them. Then the footfalls seemed to change direction, growing fainter and fainter until all she heard was the chirping of insects.  \n\nHaddie heaved a shuddering breath.  \n\nJordan gulped and swallowed a lump in his throat, saying, \"We should have respected the warning.\"   \n\n\"If that's what it was… a warning…\"   \n\n\"What else could it be?\" \n\n\"I don't know… What I do know is… we've released something foul into the world.\"   \n\n\"And by foul you mean the vampire and not gas,\" Jordan said with a smirk. \"Just clarifying.\"  \n\n\"Not funny.\" \n\n\"A little funny.\" \n\n\"No. Not even a little.\"  \n\nHaddie risked moving beyond the rocks. She glanced apprehensively, half expecting the creature to hurl itself at them. When nothing happened, she stood and, slowly and quietly, led Jordan back toward their guide.   \n\nAs she pushed her way through the woods, she couldn't help but notice the similarities between all the symbols she had seen at the last few investigation sites. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before and she had discovered them in completely different parts of the world. India. Africa. Portugal. England. Paris. And now…  Turkey.   \n\nHaddie couldn't help but feel something was amiss. She broke the silence, saying, \"We're being pulled into something far more complex than we've been led to believe. Almost like… we're being used…\" \n\n\"Used? For what? Who cares about a bunch of bozos from Montreal who release foul things into the world?\" \n\nHaddie shook her head, gave him a grave look and answered, \"I don't know. But I think it's about time we meet our mysterious—\" \n\nA twig snapped, startling the siblings.  \n\nBefore Haddie could finish her thought, the creature stood framed between two trees, dappled in sunlight.   \n\nJordan screamed in terror as the creature lunged at him, grabbing his arm and sinking its boney claws into his skin. With a mighty roar, the creature hurled him against a tree with a thud. Groaning, he sagged to the ground as inky blackness seeped down over his vision. \n\nHaddie thought quickly, spotting a fallen branch on the ground.  \n\nThe creature inched closer to Jordan, staring at him as though he were a steak.  It kneeled before him and prepared to sink its fangs into Jordan's neck to satiate its red thirst. Just as it opened its gaping mouth, a resounding yell interrupted it. \n\nThe creature hissed and turned just in time to receive a branch across the face. It fell to the side, then scrambled to its feet, locking eyes with Haddie. \n\nHaddie backed away slowly, glad she had saved her brother from certain doom, but unsure what would happen next. Then, inspired by the vampire films she had seen with her uncle Stefan, she turned the sharp side of the branch to face the creature just as it pounced on her like a lion.  \n\nThe make-shift stake hit its mark, skewering the creature straight through its monstrous heart.  \n\nThe creature shrieked something awful and collapsed to its knees, holding the stake.  \nWiping her brow, Haddie stepped away from the creature and approached her brother. But a sudden squelching sound froze her to the core. Slowly, she turned to watch the creature pull out the stake with the pulpy, dead heart still attached.  \n\nThe creature tossed the heart to the side with a mangled smile. An instant later, it pounced over Haddie, taking her to the ground. Haddie pushed and jerked under its powerful grip as it salivated and peered hungrily at the thick arterial vein pumping in her neck.  \n\nSaliva dripped down Haddie's neck slow, warm and slimy like a slug. She screamed, and then had no breath to scream and began to see not stars but…geometry… symbols… symbols she had previously discovered in The Overlap as she often called it. She didn't know what else to call what she understood to be a Venn intersection of worlds where she could see and access knowledge and memories no one else could.  \n\nHaddie closed her eyes and saw the twisted triangle symbol she had just uncovered in an ancient temple. Then she saw the strange circle slashed in half with a line that she had discovered all over the walls and floor of an abandoned asylum as though someone or something was conducting dark experiments in The Overlap on the patients. It was all very bizarre and new to her. \n\nNow, as the creature prepared to feast on her blood, Haddie wasn't seeing memories pass before her eyes but all these strange and arcane symbols that felt older than life itself—as though someone or something were trying to send her a message from The Overlap.",

Desperate hands fumbled over dirt and twigs, searching for something, anything. Then, just as the creature prepared to puncture her neck, she grabbed a rock the size of a baseball and smashed it straight through its mouth, shattering its deadly fangs.  \n\nThe creature jolted to its feet with mad agony. Pieces of bone and tooth dropped into a thick puddle of blood and saliva. Haddie turned to see Jordan moaning. He was alive, barely, nevertheless alive. Relieved, she scrambled to her feet, trying to think of a way to destroy this ancient evil once and for all.  Then she saw it— \n\nThe revolver!  \n\nHanging from the belt! \n\nWithout hesitation, she rushed up to the creature as two new white fangs pushed out the bloody remnants of the old.  Before it realized what was happening, she snatched the revolver and shot the creature point-blank in the face.   \n\nThe creature fell head over heels as Haddie unloaded the revolver into its face and body. But bullets were futile against this otherworldly apparition. Within moments the creature was clambering to its feet the whole while staring at Haddie with blood-red eyes. Nervously, she inched backward, not knowing where to go or what to do. There was nowhere to go.  Nothing she could do. This was the end. \n\nWith incredible speed and strength, the creature pounced and took Haddie to the ground. Gleaming white fangs approached her neck with malice. She jerked and kicked and screamed under its weight. She felt its warm breath inches away from the nape of her neck. Then, in her mind's eye she saw them again.  \n\nThe symbols.  \n\nAll of them.  \n\nThey swirled and flashed and then coalesced into one symbol—the symbol she had seen etched in the casket. With dawning realization, she understood. The symbol wasn't a warning but a seal—a seal to imprison this unfathomable, indescribable creature.  \n\nAs the creature prepared to gorge on her life, she managed to grab something sharp off the ground— \n\nIts broken fang! \n\nAnd with the last of her strength, she managed to etch the crescent and the three dots deep into its cheek.  \n\nSuddenly, the creature's eyes widened into great big pools of disbelief. It looked at Haddie in abject terror as it stumbled backward, desperately trying to scratch the symbol off its ghastly face.   \n\nBut it was too late.  \n\nBlack mist like acid bubbled and burned through the creature's skin. The percolating mist filled its lungs, chest and neck. The belly and chest ballooned as pressure bludgeoned the creature from within. Then, with an agonized shriek, it exploded like a cherry bomb.  \n\nCovered in gore, Haddie dragged herself beside her rousing brother. \n\n\"What did I miss?\" he groaned and sat up, leaning against the tree. He narrowed his gaze and peered through the thin red mist of blood that hung heavy in the air. \"Where's the—\"  \n\nHis voice trailed away as he noticed the shards of bone and chunks of flesh covering his clothes.  In silence, they picked off bits and pieces of the creature. Then Jordan broke the silence, saying, \"Well… this was pleasant…  pleasant as a funeral.\"  \n\nHaddie didn't respond to his stupidity. She was thinking about the symbols they had come across in their investigations.  She wondered what they meant, where they came from, and if there was something connecting all these paranormal sites they were being sent to investigate. Moreover, she wondered if their benefactor was using them in some kind of chess game against forces unknown.",

    "59646B4F4962596BC2F0B98DFEAADC9C": "This is the story the tour guide told us after showing us around the old Mad Canyon Distillery in Moonlight Bay.  She offered the adults a taste of Ole Bloody, a recipe that had been infamous during prohibition.  While we tasted the bathtub gin, no one spoke as the firewater burned down our throats. The tour guide talked about the abandoned distillery we were walking through, telling us about how the first gang had all but disappeared before the legendary Al Capone got his hands on the operation. She must have told the story often as she spoke fluidly and made gestures and pauses at all the right moments.  \n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not one for tall tales but what we know of the disappearance of the Maddy Hatter Gang is very much a vampire story if ever I heard one.  The Maddy Hatter Gang was mostly made up of the Maddock family led by the father Hank who had a thing about collecting hats from the rival gang members he butchered. He must have stolen the wrong hat because that bloodlust came back to haunt him in the fall of 1921 when his gang disappeared with only the youngest of the family left to tell the tale of what had befallen them. And what had befallen them was indeed a great mystery. A mystery people to this day bicker about and dismiss as an urban legend. But I swear it's no legend and all of it is the truth.  \n\n\"The twins Candice and Coddy, while returning with some equipment they had picked up in Ontario, drove into the valley and then carried the copper tubing and flasks into the caves where the gang prepared their white lightning. But when they arrived they found nothing but blood. Blood on the floor. Blood on the walls. Blood, if you'll believe it, running through the tubes and coils of the still. At first, they thought it may have been a rival gang. But there was no sign of bullets or bodies or even a struggle—just blood and an uncanny fog that hung low and heavy in the air.   \n\n\"The twins instantly resolved to find whoever had done this to their gang and moreover they wanted to give their siblings, cousins and parents a proper burial. So they grabbed a lantern and plunged into the twisting bowels of the mountain, following a trail of blood. They searched deep into the night with no result. Coddy shone the lantern and was just about to tell his sister he was beaten when he heard the crunch of stone in the distance.  He charged ahead, and she chased after him, stumbling over a boulder, hitting her head against the ground and losing consciousness.  \n\n\"When Candice roused, she sprang to her feet and rushed toward the flickering lantern light, screaming her brother's name. Through dancing shadow and light, she approached her pale brother sprawled over the ground with two small puncture wounds in his neck. She felt his chest for a pulse and gasped when she realized he was dead. She shuddered, then screamed, and moved by an unknown force, she grabbed the lantern and charged forward. Then, without realizing it, she entered a massive cavern, feeling the ground beneath her feet turn to mush.   \n\n\"She shone her lantern around, revealing piles of human skulls amidst thousands of beetles moving through a thick sludge. At her feet, she saw a few beetles devouring a sick bat. She tensed and looked upward to see thousands of bats sleeping. A few beetles scurried over her foot with morsels of rotting flesh and she kicked them away. She swallowed her fear, realizing that if she woke the bats, they would strip her flesh clean in a matter of minutes.  Then she glanced at familiar barrels in the corner by a pile of animal bones. \n\n\"Silently and carefully, she made her way past the bones.  Opening the barrel, she cringed as a horrible stench assaulted her nose. She peered at the dark brew and wasn't sure what she was looking at. Then she realized she was staring at fermenting lumps of flesh in thick, putrid blood. She was in the vampire's lair.  But before she could continue her search, a roar suddenly startled her.  \n\n\"Candice turned and found herself staring at a demon with fangs with a swirling black fog rising at its feet. Through the fog, she saw it was wearing her father's hat. She gave a shout of revenge like thunder. The vampire twisted its ugly head in startled disbelief. Fearlessly, Candice threw herself at the vampire. She didn't care what this thing was or where it came from. She just wanted it dead, and she wanted to do her family proud. The vampire meant to kill her by sinking its fangs in her neck. But she felt strong enough to bring down a mountain.  \n\n\"And so she jerked and kicked and pushed its snarling face. With a snarl of her own, she bit back at the vampire, tearing pale flesh off its neck with teeth and jaws strong enough to crush rock.  Before the vampire realized what was happening, she gouged its eye with her thumb, ramming it deeper and deeper as it desperately clawed flesh off her arms and face. But she didn't care. She would not be denied, and within moments she felt the delicate brain matter like warm mud and smiled. Then she curled her finger and yanked as hard as she could with a mad laugh.  \n\n\"With a shriek, the vampire convulsed violently, then stopped all at once, its jaws frozen in a twisted, agonized howl. Unable to control her growing laughter, she took back her father's hat and stood proudly as open wounds leaked and sputtered blood. Then the fog rolled over the vampire and somehow made it all disappear. The vampire. The bats. The beetles. The blood. Everything.  \n\n\"Needless to say, no one believed Candice and she was put into an asylum to shut-up and wither away. But eventually, some rich philanthropist took charge of her, and she was never seen again.\"  \n\nEveryone was silent. Someone laughed and said, \"That's not really a vampire story, is it?\"  \n\nThe tour guide replied, \"Not like we're used to, no. But that's her story and I swear I told it like I heard it.\" \n\nThen a young woman, in a concerned voice, added, \"I hope that girl ended up all right.\" ",

Knees bruised, she prays to the gods, pleading, silently screaming for an answer. Nothing. The wind remains calm. She is alone, surrounded by stone, looked down upon by statues of gods unmoved. Dust floats through the air, settles on her skin, more real than anything she ever believed. A lifetime of faith, security, crumbles. She feels unsteady, the only certainty in her mind that she must leave this place. She rises to her feet, turns her back to the temple, only then—<br><br>A whisper!<br><br>The hushed chitter in her head is unclear, inarticulate words passed through a forked tongue.

Through gritted teeth, she screams, keeping the sound in the base of her throat so no one can hear. ATONE! She swings, droplets of blood sprinkling to the floor. Spasms of pain, as skin tears off, hanging on pale threads. Braces herself and whips again, again, till the crimson pools. ATONE! How much blood is enough? Her body screams in agony. She thinks to drop the lash, run from these walls, but remembers the doctrine Haban taught her: Suffering is the heart of love. She tightens her grip and swings again.",

Future nightmares being scripted. The moment broken by a single woman’s scream, followed by a hundred more. Jeffrey can’t hold it any longer. He bellows laughter, nearly suffocates with glee. No one can hear over the turmoil. Half the crowd rushes to the exit, needing air, needing to be sick, needing a stiff drink. What a show! Jeffrey chuckles, wipes his tears, and then—oh my.

He had saved and reunited so many families and so many were grateful and indebted and still… he never mentioned him.  \n\nMaybe he didn’t want a legend, Jake. Maybe he wanted something else.

Think of her as your boss and think of grades as money. Parrot her ideas and opinions and you’ll be rewarded with lots of money… maybe even a bonus or a promotion.   \n\nEasy enough advice to follow.  \n\nAnd yet his father’s advice did nothing to improve his sense of otherness in relation to the stories and curriculum he was subjected to on an almost daily basis. He still felt like an outsider for lacking interest in the literature and history he was expected to read and memorize as truths undeniable. Seemed like there was a big chunk of perspective missing from the overall narrative being poured into him like concrete that made him feel like he didn’t belong.  \n\nBut what does it matter now?  \n\nIt doesn’t.  \n\nLeave the past in the past and focus on what needs to get done.  \n\nI’m trying.  \n\nListen here, big brother… the sun’s coming down, you’re having conversations with yourself, and your cells are about to cannibalize one another.

Maybe he just wanted a father… A living, breathing father to do shit with… kinda like what you got.  ",

He takes in the scent of thick, fatty, white bacon melting into mounds of burning black charcoal. He reaches around his father and pulls off a strip and devours it. His father smiles and says it’s like he’s never seen food before.  \n\nJake’s eyes widen as thick, droplets of grease drip off his chin. He suddenly pushes past his father and brother, attacking the grill, stuffing his face with greasy, life-giving fat and protein. His father tries to hold him back but Jake won’t be denied when suddenly the meat morphs into a living, wild hog. The hog turns to Jake and winks.  \n\nJake stumbles back and falls into the pool.  \n\nThe pool swirls and turns into a deadfall as several spikes rip through his chest. Jake yells in agony, waking up with a start, finding himself in a small pit beside thick, sharpened branches pointed outward.  \n\nJake wipes the sweat off his brow and slowly clambers to his feet. He climbs out of the deadfall and stares into the darkness of the cave for a long moment. Then he hears his mother’s soothing voice.  \n\nJake… please… finish the letter and send it to him.  \n\nWhy? What’s the use? It’s just gonna end up in a shoebox in the attic like his father’s letter.  \n\nYou’re wrong. It will be like the picture in his wallet.  \n\nThat’s just a stupid picture!  \n\nNot to him.   ",

He watches the darkness fill with lashing, flames and swirling, smoke, and he waits for the inevitable. As he stares at the thickening smoke, he’s reminded of a story and his thoughts drift away to his grandfather.  \n\nHe reunited so many broken families. He helped so many people survive exposure, exhaustion and starvation. He saved them all and yet… he couldn’t save himself.  \n\nThey said there was a kind of smoke, too… a thick black smoke that suddenly surrounded them. One minute he was there. The next… he was gone. The survivors Jake had spoken to in Seoul said he was probably captured and executed but that they didn’t know for sure.  \n\nA piercing squeal followed by a meaty thunk suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. He didn’t even see the hog make a dash for it. He leans over the pit and stares at the skewered hog shaking and convulsing as life pours out of its wounds.  \n\nJake sighs and feels mingled relief and regret. Sorry, brother… it was either you or me.  ",

Took the whole day to get him but it was worth it. There’s enough meat on him to last him months. The bloody and carved hog suddenly turns to Jake. But you didn’t really get me, did you? Jake blinks. And blinks, again. Truth is I let you catch me cause I figured you chased me long enough. Jake shakes his head in disbelief, and he knows his mind is still playing tricks on him despite having eaten. The hog sighs sadly. You and I, Jake, we’re caught in the same vicious cycle so don’t feel so bad, all right? Today it’s me. Tomorrow it’s you.  \n\nJake pinches himself but the hog continues. Chase something long enough and it will surrender itself to you. It will stop running and let you catch it so long as you stay the course. Just like that story you chased in the old country. Jake narrows his gaze on the grinning hog. Now you’re here on Blood Mountain trying to be your grandfather while trying to forget your father without realizing you’re both and neither of them at the same time.  \n\nJake tries to shake the hallucination out of his head. Don’t worry, Jake, I’m not really talking… you’re tired and dehydrated… and completely lost in the woods. I’m just trying to give you some perspective or rather… you’re trying to give yourself some perspective.  \n\nJake sighs deeply. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do and I’m talking to a dead hog in the middle of nowhere. The hog nods. Yes, you are. It’s interesting because your grandfather was poor and didn’t have many options and you’re not so poor and have too many options… I’m not sure which is worse… the tyranny of too little or the tyranny of too much… either way… a distracted life is a wasted life…  \n\nIt’s good that you came out here to figure things out. And you know what else is good? If you let go… if you just let go…  \n\nI have let go and I’m still as lost as I ever was.  \n\nThe hog snorts. You haven’t let go, Jake. You’re still playing the old scripts over and over again like a broken record. But let’s see… you like chasing stories… especially the hidden ones… you talk to yourself constantly… and you like being alone… maybe you’re a writer, Jake. Or maybe you’re a historian. \n\nJake laughs out loud. Are you kidding me! I hate history, and I failed every English class in high school cause I thought the rules were stupid and the teachers were boring.  \n\nYou and every other writer that actually made a dent. English class doesn’t make a writer, Jake… Fighting class and dancing class do.   \n\nI don’t even know what that means!  \n\nIt means you need guts and style, not grades and diplomas. It means you need courage and not the validation of some coward that doesn’t know what it’s like to lead someone on a dancefloor or step into a ring. It means your country needs a lot more stories like yours. Because let’s face it, Jake, if your story isn’t in the main narrative… if you’re just a footnote in a history book… you may as well not exist.  \n\nYou’re not your grandfather, Jake. You’re not your father either. And every generation has its challenge. Oppression. War. Separation. Maybe the challenge of your generation is… representation. You gotta get your stories out there whether you’re a writer, historian, filmmaker or producer. Seems to me a lot of kids like you in the new country need to hear your story or stories like yours to know they aren’t alone. To know they belong and that they aren’t outsiders in their own home.  \n\nA chorus of howls brings Jake back to the moment. Wolves! And they’re coming for what’s mine! They howl again, and above the racquet he hears his father’s voice. In every transaction, Jake, there are wolves.  \n\nNot in this one.  \n\nEspecially this one.  \n\nJake ignores the voice in his head and tries to focus as he considers his next move carefully. ",

Another howl rents the night and the chirping insects go silent. The wolves are coming, and they want what’s rightfully his. He’s glad he ate, and he feels new life coursing through his veins. He feels his focus sharpening, and yet he still hears his mother. \n\nYou should have finished the letter when you had a chance.  \n\nI’ll finish it another time.  \n\nIf you get ‘another time’ Jake.  \n\nI will.  \n\nAnd what If you die here? What if you go missing? Your father will sell everything just to find you.  \n\nYeah, right. All he cares about is his packaging empire.   \n\nYou really don’t know your father if that’s what you think… or why he carries that picture with him everywhere he goes. \n\nJake scoffs. The picture means nothing! Even the fortune-teller didn’t know what it meant.  \n\nBut it means something to him, Jake. It means the world to him. You point your finger at your father and accuse him of not understanding you… but did you ever try to understand him?  \n\nSeveral wolves approach the tree and peer up at Jake with eyes that reflect the shining full moon. Jake tries to silence the voice and reign his focus on the threat at hand. But the voice—the voice of family—refuses to be silenced. \n\nLet me tell you something about your father, Jake… If he could give all his money away for just one chance to meet his father, he would. And… if you disappear because you were too pig-headed to let go… he’d drop everything just to find you. We all would.  \n\nLet go, Jake, and the wolves will disappear.  ",

Jake holds the cord tightly with one hand as he uses the other hand to attack the wolves with a branch. He’s exhausted and doesn’t know what to do. He feels like a tick beaten and battered by the rain… broken… beaten… defeated… Not by the hunt, or the wolves but the thoughts and emotions swarming in his head like a hive of anxious bees.  \n\nThe wolves circle the tree with cackles and growls that seem like laughter in the night. How the hell did I end up here? Up a tree fighting wolves in the middle of nowhere! And how the hell am I gonna get down? He hears his brother’s voice break through the din below.  \n\nThe stupid shit we do when we’re lost and alone, right bro?  \n\nJake swallows a growing lump in his throat and admits the truth for the first time in years. You’ve always seen right through me, little bro. God, I miss you. But you’re right… I am lost and I am alone… and I have no idea who I am or what I want to do with my life… and that fortune-teller was right… I didn’t know what to choose… so I chose nothing.  \n\nHis mother’s voice returns. No, Jake. He was wrong. You did choose something.  \n\nJake draws a deep shuddering breath and closes his eyes, remembering his first birthday as his mother had described it so many times.  \n\nHe’s dressed in his first red and blue Hanbok, sitting on a white blanket with all kinds of objects spread before him. Pens. Rice. Paint. Ink. Brushes. Money. His aunts, uncles and cousins encourage him to choose something with exaggerated baby-talk.  \n\nThe fortune-teller asks everyone to be quiet and says the object Jake picks first will be the driving motivation of his life. The birthday boy drags himself toward the objects… drags himself past the pen… past the rice and the cake… past the ink and the brushes… nothing seems to interest him. But then—\n\nHe spots something. His eyes go wide with excitement, and he charges toward—\n\nThe money!  \n\nYells! Screams! More baby-talk to encourage him to take the money! But— \n\nJake doesn’t take the money. He doesn’t even look at it. He surprises everyone by charging past the money with perfect focus and he only stops when he reaches a man kneeling in prayer. One-year-old Jake looks up at his father, smiles, and grabs his finger. His father smiles back at him, and his mother takes a picture— \n\nThe picture.  \n\nJake opens his eyes and now he hears his mother’s voice above the snapping and snarling wolves. The fortune-teller didn’t really know what to tell us. He said we didn’t arrange the objects properly. He said you chose nothing. But I think we both know he was wrong.   \n\nI don’t understand… \n\nIt’s been years, Jake. Finish the letter. Teach him about his father. And come back home.   \n\nI wouldn’t know what to write… what to say… \n\nYou’ll figure it out. Just remember that he respects what you did because in the end he knows…  \n\nYou chose family.  \n\nYou always did, and you always will. That’s why I know you’ll do what needs to be done. Come back… help him complete his story.  \n\nThe imaginary words strike Jake’s heart like lightning. His eyes widen with sudden understanding, and for the first time in his life he wonders… he wonders what it would have been like to grow up without a father. To miss all the things his father gave him. To miss all the things he took for granted… \n\nHiking. Fishing. Hunting. Camping. Fun and fierce games of Baduk in moonlit tents. It wasn’t all superficial bullshit. There was good, too. A lot of good.  \n\nHe was so contradictory.  \n\nAren’t we all. \n\nI suppose we are.  \n\nJake loosens his grip on the cord and stares at the frenzied wolves below, and for the first time in his life, he knows exactly what he needs to do.

Other Terra Worlds have quite unique and sometimes contradictory versions of the Harbinger series which make them difficult to track and interpret. But despite the discrepancies, each version seems to feature siblings trying to expose a nefarious cult devoted to The Entity.  \n\nI am currently searching the rift for the real memories that inspired all these adventures to see how close they are to the actual inspiration. I’m even wondering if Haddie and Jordan are here, trapped in The Entity, and, if they are, I’m hoping their memories will somehow help me find a way out of here. So far, I have found nothing close to a real memory, but I did find another story from Terra 717 in which Haddie discusses a phenomenon she calls ‘The Overlap’ and which other stories call The Borro, The Coil, The Bleed, etc.  \n\nI’m currently keeping extensive notes on the Harbinger stories and their descriptions of The Overlap to see if any of them can give me insight into what this phenomenon actually is. What I’ve discovered so far is that almost all of these stories describe places where a dark dimension intersects with the world and that these intersections seem to attract tragedy and misfortune. Some of these stories go so far as to claim ‘broken’ or ‘traumatized’ people can derive strange abilities from the vibrations emanating from these dark and ‘cursed’ places. These people can ultimately use The Bleed—my preferred name for the phenomenon—to access knowledge beyond the veil as it were.  \n\nThe Harbinger series from Terra 719 is also worth noting because the details included by the author seem closest to what we studied back home concerning Ancients and living dimensions, not to mention what I’ve been able to discover by examining the memories of souls marooned here. Piece by piece, or rather, story by story, I’m getting closer to salvation… or insanity… whichever comes first.  ",

He stopped chewing his early morning, scrambled eggs and asked, “What’s this supposed to be?”  \n\n“I know who our mysterious benefactor is!” Haddie opened the envelope and pulled out a picture of a middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair in a dark suit.  \n\nJordan shrugged. “Who am I looking at?” \n\n“Surin Rivera. He was a sound engineer for a highly classified military project in the Office of Strategic Operations. He experienced a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized for years until he was released under the care of billionaire, philanthropist Kobe Dax. Others in the same program experienced similar breakdowns. One lives close by. The question is… why is Surin helping us?”  \n\nJordan raised his finger and pointed to a man standing behind Haddie. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Haddie turned to face the man in the picture standing beside her.  \n\nSurin took a seat beside Jordan and said, “You need to leave my case alone. I assure you both… You’re not ready for what you’re prying into.”  \n\n“And what is that?” Haddie questioned.  \n\nJordan took a small, nervous bite of his eggs and chewed slowly. “Let’s not provoke the man, sis. If we’re not ready… we’re not ready… I’m good with that.”  \n\n“How do you know our uncle?” Haddie asked when he didn’t answer her question. “Why are you helping us? What are these places you’re sending us to?”  \n\nSurin peered at Haddie for a long moment. Then he said, “Let’s just say I have a fond interest in your work and your special abilities.”  \n\nJordan swallowed and shrugged. “Okay… sure… that’s good enough for me.”  \n\n“Not me.” Haddie’s face hardened as she waited for an answer. “I want to know why your helping us.”  \n\nSurin scanned the deli nervously, then turned back to Haddie and Jordan. “Take my advice and don’t go down this rabbit hole. Not yet. You’re not ready, and you’re exposing yourself to dangerous people.”  \n\n“What kind of people?” Haddie narrowed her gaze on him. “Police? Military? What are we talking about here?”  \n\nSurin shook his head gravely. “We’re talking about people who don’t answer to the police or military. People who create governments and corporations to use to their end and then throw them away like garbage when they’re done.”  \n\n“What do they want?” Haddie asked, unsatisfied with his answer.  \n\nSurin stood. “Leave my case alone. Focus on the show and the leads I send your way. All will be revealed in due time.” \n\nHaddie held up the envelope with his picture. “I’m getting ahead of myself… is that it?” \n\n“Leave my case alone,” Surin repeated and walked away.  \n\nHaddie and Jordan watched Surin exit the deli in silence. Then Jordan turned to see Haddie’s determined expression, and he knew they weren’t leaving anything alone.  ",

Let’s get ahead of ourselves!” Haddie led Jordan to the entrance of a dilapidated house in the suburbs. “Colonel Jim Dunn worked with Surin Rivera in the OSO.” Before Haddie could say another word the door creaked open, revealing a plump, middle-age woman with short blond hair.  \n\n“Can I help you?” \n\nHaddie smiled. “Yes. I was actually hoping to speak to Col Lt Dunn for our podcast.”  \n\nThe woman took a step back. “Is this some kind of a prank?”  \n\nHaddie shook her head. “No, ma’am.” \n\n“Jim disappeared seven years ago. No one has any answers for me, and all I’m left with are rumors.” \n\nJordan inched closer to the woman. “Maybe our podcast could help? Maybe someone out there can help you if you share his story.”  \n\n“Share his story?” The woman hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded and said, “Yeah… all right… I just want my Jim back.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan entered the home and followed her to the kitchen where they sat around a small, round table.  \n\n“I can only tell you what Jim told me,” the woman said, taking a deep breath and releasing it slowly to calm her nerves. “He worked for the Office of Strategic Operations which was… I guess you could say… the stuff of conspiracy theories.”  \n\nShe paused, then continued. “Did you know Jim said the word ‘conspiracy theory’ used to never exist until the military created the term? Once you could actually question the government’s narrative but now… you’re not questioning anything because you don’t want to be called a ‘conspiracy theorist.’” \n\nThe woman laughed, then added, “Brilliant, really, and that’s pretty much why no one questions the government anymore… even if you’ve got a dozen whistleblowers with leaked documents all saying the same thing… you don’t really doubt or question anything cause you don’t want to be stigmatized.” \n\nThe woman shook her head in disbelief and continued with a little laugh. “Jim used to say the origin of ‘conspiracy theory’ is a conspiracy theory… anyway… he told me… there were places in the world that weren’t like other places… places which defied the laws of physics… which defied human comprehension… places connected to worlds away… to other dimensions… the government called it The Overlap. Crazy stuff, right? ” \n\nJordan nodded.  \n\nHaddie didn’t respond. She had heard the term before when they were investigating a mysterious cult that believed in a kind of ancient deity that would one day help humanity evolve to another plane of existence. It’s a strange coincidence that this cult and the government would have the same name for the phenomenon.  \n\n“Like a wormhole?” Jordan questioned.  \n\nThe woman shook her head. “That’s not how Jim described it. He didn’t talk much about The Overlap but he said what they had seen made him think another world was… how did he put it… consuming ours… like these Overlaps were growing bigger and bigger as we went down a kind of celestial digestive track… and… he said… he said they were pulling stuff out… things from other worlds….”  \n\nThe woman fell silent and thoughtful for a long moment. “I could see changes in him. He was getting angrier and mean and he was never mean. He stopped sharing things with me. And I started hearing rumors.” \n\n“What kind of rumors?” Haddie asked, leaning forward.  \n\nThe woman went silent and thoughtful. Then she said, “Rumors that the government was doing things to them so they could stay in The Overlap for longer periods of time. I even heard that they pulled someone out from another world. Imagine that… a person from another world or dimension.” \n\nTears filled her eyes. “They say he left me… but I know my Jim… something happened to him and the authorities dismiss me as conspiracy theorist for saying otherwise. But I’ll tell you this—” \n\nA sudden report and the woman’s mouth filled with thick, warm blood as she tried to speak. Shattered teeth and saliva gushed out instead of words. Then her eye went wide and she slumped forward.  \n\nJordan cursed and instantly tackled Haddie to the ground as bullets began to rip through the house from every direction.  \n\nHaddie stared up at her brother as bullets flew over their heads like angry wasps. “I think… we got ahead of ourselves.” \n\n“You think!”  ",

They stumbled down the stairs into the darkness and through a beam of sunlight pouring through a rectangular window. Before they could hide, the assassin was already descending the stairs with his rifle trained on them. Haddie and Jordan held hands and closed their eyes waiting for a quick death. A loud report sounded and when they opened their eyes they were both still standing.  \n\nThe assassin stared at them with big white eyes of disbelief, then he collapsed to reveal Surin holding a smoking revolver. “Come on,” he said. “We need to leave before others come.”  \n\nThe siblings didn’t hesitate, following Surin up the stairs and out the door past several dead bodies. Haddie counted seven dead assassins by the time she followed her brother into an unmarked black sedan. With a great sense of urgency, Surin started the engine, hit the accelerator and the car peeled away. After a silence, Haddie asked, “Is any of it true? The rumors? Worlds intersecting? The Overlap?”  \n\nSurin didn’t take his eyes off the road as he drove them back to the hotel where their uncle was waiting for them. “I can’t really answer that right now and you need to focus on your next episode. You’re here to investigate the old, abandoned subway station, and I think you should stick to the agenda.”  \n\n“Is it an Overlap?” Jordan asked. “Is that why there were so many accidents? Is that why it was abandoned?”   \n\nSurin hesitated, then nodded gravely.  \n\n“What do you and a billionaire care about the old, subway?” Haddie asked.  \n\nSurin sighed, took a moment to find his words, then answered. “I’m looking for my colleagues. We explored these areas all over the world and a few of us never returned and those that did… they came back to us… lost… confused… insane, even. I want answers. I want to know what happened to the others. I know they’re still alive. They’re lost somewhere… between worlds.”  \n\n“So you’re using us to find them?” Haddie said flatly.  \n\n“We’re helping each other in mutually beneficial ways.”  \n\nHaddie shook her head. “I need to know more. That’s not enough for me.”  \n\nSurin sighed and pulled the sedan over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine. After a long thoughtful moment, he looked at the siblings in the rear-view mirror and said, “I was undergoing some, let’s say, unorthodox training to enter The Overlap… but it wasn’t possible… it’s like an impossible energy that pulls… I don’t know… hell… pulls hell right out of you… I mean there’s no other way to describe it. What you feel is just pure darkness. But the OSO figured when the mind is developing it can be… it can be fractured… broken in ways so that it rewires itself to withstand the stress of The Overlap.” \n\n“You turned children into tools!” Jordan spat in disgust. \n\nSurin looked away from the rear-view mirror and lowered his gaze without answering.  \n\n“And so I’m your new tool,” Haddie said. There was a short silence as Haddie considered her last few investigations. She remembered finding journals in the old asylum that had notes about other realms. Memories of other people trapped in a deathless world and journal entries revealing thoughts about how artists and writers were able to somehow tune into these other worlds with what they believed was their imagination but what was actually their third eye. It was a strange theory that Haddie had dismissed as the ravings of a depraved lunatic with a wild imagination. But something the patient had written had stuck with her.  \n\nThe truth is in the story.   \n\nHaddie whispered the words to herself and thought she would give those notebooks another read in case she had missed something. She had them stored in her studio apartment in Montreal and would force Stefan to make a detour before their next investigation.  \n\n“You don’t understand,” Surin continued. “This isn’t just about the friends I lost… There are things in The Overlap we need to understand. There could be a new type of energy… a new way of seeing the world… the universe—”  \n\nJordan interrupted with a laugh. “Or… there’s nothing there… and it’s just a living hell.”  ",

What we do know is generators at the power company exploded into violent flames taking down powerlines leaving the western sector of the city in the dark. City Police report these unknown creatures attacked several automobiles near the company and are considered extremely dangerous. At least three motorists are dead and four others are in critical condition. Motorists are urged to avoid roads near the power station and the 93 South. That’s the latest we have on the attacks. We’ll keep you informed as the situation develops. We now return to Money-Bake with the latest advice from our financial analyst brought to you by The Now-or-Never Wealth Management Firm… because you can never be sure what the future will bring.  ",

The spokesperson for the Falls City General Hospital reports an unusual and alarming increase of poison cases due to an unknown spider the size of a fist with bright orange spiral-like markings on its back. The authorities are calling it the hell-back spider and advise you to stay at least two meters away from the spider should you come in contact with one. Federal officials say they are trying to cope with this situation and are still trying to determine if this is in fact a terrorist attack or another phenomenon known as ‘Spontaneous Evolution’ in which new species suddenly appear without any plausible scientific explanation. Other theories suggest a government experiment gone wrong as in the case of the weaponized ticks carrying the human-made Lyme disease variant that escaped from a classified biological warfare laboratory on Apricot Island. The situation seems to be reaching emergency proportions as more and more districts lose power. The city’s coroner’s office says dozens of corpses now reveal the poison from the hell-back spider to be slow and lethal as boils and puss slowly cover the body. There also seem to be indications that some victims go on murderous rampages induced by fever, overactive adrenal glands and what can only be described as a complete loss of sanity. Infected individuals are to be handled with extreme caution until the boils cover the entire body and movement becomes practically impossible. A representative of the Falls City Power Company says they are actively trying to fix the generators to restore electricity but a strange black fog is slowing down repair crews. Anonymous workers at the company are saying on social media that they are hearing strange sounds coming from the fog and believe it may somehow be linked to the spiders. One report claims a worker’s body burst open with spiders after she inhaled the fog. Another report says that before the initial attacks, carcasses of deer were found with thousands if not millions of spiders crawling out of them. I should repeat that… There is a fog and it seems to be carrying microscopic eggs that require a biological host… We advise people to stay calm and take extreme caution if they come in contact with the fog or a hell-back spider. We’ll get back to you with further developments. In the meantime back to Money-Bake brought to you by The Now-or-Never Management Firm… because today’s tragedy is tomorrow’s golden opportunity.  ",

I forced myself to look and very quickly realized that these pods weren’t filled with food but with something else. It was clear that something was moving and growing inside the cocoon. Something was feeding off the dripping body parts that had been wrapped with it. The groaning creature inside the cocoon struggled to break free, and I instantly rushed out of the lab as fast as my trembling legs could take me.

    "0FA0D8984DDB5B7959538CBB6D60AC91": "Constable Duncan J. Smith said thousands of dogs haunted him wherever he went, but no one else saw them. To get away from the dogs he would hide in the crawl space underneath his cabin, or he would hide in the shed where he kept his snowmobile, or sometimes he would escape to the glaciers and hide in the ice caves where he prayed for the howling and the yelping and the whimpering to stop. But the howling and the yelping and the whimpering never stopped, and no matter where he hid, the dogs always found him.  \n\nThe first day Duncan saw the dogs was the day he started questioning his job. Or rather, it was the day he started questioning the law and what he was doing with the law. There was something about legally destroying dogs that felt off… that felt… wrong… something that tugged at his heart and wouldn’t let go… something telling him that he needed to get out of the cold, lonely Arctic Archipelago before it was too late—if it wasn’t already too late.  \n\nFor Duncan, it was the first time in his career as a police officer that he realized that the law wasn’t always the glorified tool for civilization he had imagined it to be. Sometimes the law was something else.  Something blunt. Something hard.  Something almost like a gavel… a gavel of destruction or oppression or perhaps both—destruction and oppression.  \n\nTruth is, Duncan wasn’t sure what he was thinking anymore. He was exhausted, and the dogs… well… the dogs just wouldn’t leave him be, and all he wanted to do was return home and farm. He liked working on the farm. Things were simpler on the farm. But here, up north, things were more complicated, and Duncan couldn’t help but think about the law.  \n\nAbout the gavel.  \n\nAnd the last thing Duncan wanted to do was wield that gavel against anyone. And yet—to his everlasting regret—he had used it against the dogs.  \n\nAnd though he had done everything by the book… and though the law said he had committed no crime… his heart continually testified to the opposite.   \n\nTo be sure, Duncan had led countless dogs to the bay, where he had shot them like vermin in front of their owners. And it was only when he was alone and surrounded by their ghosts that he would admit to himself that what he had done didn’t feel so right and that maybe… just maybe… these dogs weren’t the dangerous beasts or the diseased rats his captain had made them out to be. They were… well… they were something else.   \n\nThey were friends.  \n\nThey were family members.  \n\nThey played with children, entertained them and kept them safe. They warned against approaching wolves and polar bears, and even snowstorms. And more than anything they made sure no hunter ever got lost in a blizzard unlike those unreliable ‘iron dogs’ or snowmobiles that broke down in the middle of nowhere and left a trail of black smoke across the cold, white, endless expanse. No ‘iron dog’ ever led someone out of a blizzard. The same… well… the same could not be said of the dogs…  \n\n…the dogs he had so heartlessly destroyed.  \n\nBut in those days—when the production of the first commercial ‘iron dog’ commenced—there weren’t many challenges to the law, and so Duncan certainly tried to convince himself that he was doing the good and lawful thing for everyone.  \n\nAnd while it’s true that the mind might not make the difference between what is right and what is lawful, the heart certainly does.   \n\nThe heart—it is often said—doesn’t lie.  \n\nNonetheless, Duncan found ways to trick himself and ignore the appeals of his heart. He told himself these dogs weren’t like other dogs, and he actually believed his lie for a few months. But as time wore on, he very quickly realized that these dogs were… well… like the dogs he had known back home.  \n\nKnowing this made it harder and harder for him to fall asleep, and soon he started to hallucinate and see all the dogs he had shot.  \n\nAt first it was just one. Then it was two. Then a dozen. Then a dozen became a hundred. And a hundred became a thousand. A thousand dead dogs howled and stared at Duncan every night, preventing him from sleeping, from dreaming, from thinking—preventing him from living the life he had once known.    \n\nEverywhere Duncan went, there they were, the dogs, looking at him with those eyes—those pleading, confused eyes, wondering what they had done wrong, or how they had failed their family and friends to deserve such a cold and indifferent end.  \n\nTruth is, Duncan couldn’t escape those ghosts any more than a dog could escape its own tail. Wherever he went, there they were, following him, reminding him of all the lives he had disrupted and destroyed with… well… with that gavel.  \n\nOne evening, Duncan sat in bed, holding his aching head in his hands, staring at the decaying dogs sitting all around him. They watched him closely as he tried to fall asleep and howled or barked every time his eyelids began to slip. Trembling with fear and exhaustion, Duncan murmured he had done nothing wrong and that he had acted in accordance with the law and that they should just leave him alone. But— \n\nThe dogs wouldn’t leave him alone. They just stared at him in silence with those eyes—eyes that reminded him of his own dog.   \n\nAnguished, Duncan lurched from his bed, screaming at the dogs, telling them he needed to sleep and that he wasn’t going to feel guilty for doing his damn job! He outright refused to apologize or feel guilty for doing what the law required him to do. What the law said he had to do!  \n\nThe dogs suddenly stirred anxiously about the cabin with their heads down and tails between their legs. Duncan’s screams grew louder and louder, and one by one, the dogs whimpered and whined for their lives like they had done when they had been destroyed. Then—just like that—they vanished into thin air as though Duncan had finally scared them away.   \n\nWhen Duncan realized the dogs were gone, he collapsed into his bed and prayed that they should finally leave him alone. He just wanted his life back, for the dogs had robbed him of his strength and freedom and even his sense of identity as a morally upright officer of the law.   \n\nThat night, a storm picked up and blew all around his small cabin. Feeling a chill seep through his bones, Duncan rose from the bed, and he made a small fire in the iron stove as he remembered his first and only dog, Buster, a plump Yellow Labrador Retriever with a black snout.  \n\nSmartest, kindest and warmest dog he had ever known.   \n\nTo Duncan, Buster was more than just a dog. He was his guardian, his confidant, his best friend. He was the brother he never had. He caught rodents, guarded against coyotes and drove cattle on the farm. His father used to say a good dog was worth two or three farm-hands, and Buster was certainly worth four. Thinking about it now, he was glad that no one ever used the law against Buster, or any other dog in his town for that matter.  \n\nTo be sure, Buster wasn’t as big or strong as these Arctic dogs, but he was quite the hunter and had once even saved him from a wolverine. But what Duncan remembered most was that Buster used to curl up in bed with him to calm his anxious heart and help him drift away to sleep.   \n\nAnd now Duncan longed for nothing more than the undisturbed, soundless sleep of youth.  And as he longed for sleep, the wind blew harder and fiercer through the cracks of his cabin. The fire flared, flickered and snapped, casting violent shadows that seemed to tell stories.   \n\nDuncan rubbed his eyes to make the hallucinations go away. But wherever he looked the shadows took the form of officers and hunters shooting at confused and frightened dogs as a thick and unnatural black smoke began to fill the cabin.  \n\nDuncan tried to pinch himself awake. But when he realized he wasn’t asleep, he quickly shut his eyes and once again begged for the dogs to just leave him alone.  \n\nHe wanted one night of rest. Just one night! His brain reeled with despair, and he began to hear the warped voice of his captain laughing at him, shouting at him, tormenting him, telling him the dogs were dangerous… aggressive… a definite blight on their future plans.  \n\nDuncan felt madness clutching at the seams of his soul. He screamed that these were lies! All of them!  And when he opened his eyes again, the black smoke was gone, and the shadows were once again meaningless shapes flickering about the cabin.   \n\nBut just as Duncan sighed his relief, he heard a sound.  \n\nA gentle, scratching sound. At the door. Then he heard a bark that sounded vaguely familiar. The bark came again and again and it sounded like— \n\nBuster.  \n\nDuncan narrowed his gaze and cautiously approached the thick, wooden door. The scratching stopped just as he placed his hand on the doorknob. He stood in silence for a long, tense moment. When the scratching came again, he quickly opened the door and caught a fleeting glimpse of yellow fur disappearing beyond thick sheets of falling snow.   \n\nExhausted and confused, Duncan rushed into the churning storm in his undergarments and slippers, yelling for Buster to wait for him. Then he stopped suddenly when he realized he was being irrational. His tired mind was playing tricks on him.  \n\nBuster had been dead for over twenty years. He had been hit by a car. And for a fleeting moment, Duncan remembered holding his paw on the side of the road, calming him down as his life slowly seeped away. He had never cried so much in his life. There was no possible way Buster could still be with him.  \n\nCovered in snow, Duncan told himself the solitude was getting to him and that he just needed one night of undisturbed sleep. He turned back toward the cabin. But as he turned, he realized…  \n\n…he was lost.  \n\nHe couldn’t see an inch in front of him in any direction.  Cold and panic swept over him at once.  He turned and turned as the wind howled and shrieked and whimpered. In the raging blizzard, he could only make out— \n\nDogs.  \n\nGhostly dogs. Dead and decaying dogs. Thousands of them. Running around him. Growling. Howling. Barking. Confusing him.  \n\nDuncan shouted for them to stop, and he tried to scare them off as he had done before. But the dogs grew faster and fiercer as though they were one with the storm.  \n\nDuncan fell to his knees and felt the cold bite all over his trembling body. His face twisted in terror as each dog seemed to pounce out of the storm to take its turn chomping down on him with cold, indifferent teeth. He collapsed to his side in agony. A terrible numbness crept over him, not so much from the cold but the memory of hurting all those poor dogs. He begged for them to stop, and then he did what he had never done before.  \n\nHe confessed his shame and begged for forgiveness.   \n\nAt once, the dogs froze and stared at him with eyes that seemed to look straight into his heart.    \n\nDuncan choked out that he was sorry, that he was truly sorry, and that even though he had done everything by the book, he had done everything wrong. He had done them wrong. He had done their families wrong. And he had done himself wrong.  \n\nAnd as he emptied his heart, he heard a familiar bark as Buster suddenly emerged from the ghostly pack and stood before him.   \n\nThe dogs looked at Buster, then Duncan, then Buster again. A wave of peace seemed to wash over them as they disappeared one by one and left Duncan with his guardian… his friend… his brother. And Buster curled down beside Duncan as his heart slowed to a stop, and the blinding, white storm swept his life away as it had done so many others.  \n\n \n\nWhen Constable Duncan J. Smith didn’t show up at the station the next day, his fellow officers searched for him and found his frozen corpse not ten feet from his cabin. He was lying on his side with a peaceful expression on his face. One officer noticed that he had been running around in circles, while the others questioned why he had been foolish enough to leave his cabin in his undergarments in the middle of a snowstorm.  \n\nThe captain kneeled by Duncan’s frozen black and blue face and sighed.  Just as he ordered someone to cover the body, another officer panicked and rubbed his eyes, claiming he saw dogs all around him.  He stumbled back and screamed for the dogs to stay away from him. No one saw what he was seeing, and the captain told him to stop making jokes at Duncan’s expense. But the frantic officer shrieked in terror and swore that the dogs were real and that they were following him.  ",

Other civilizations collapse because of natural disasters. And yet other civilizations get a little push… a little nudge… over the cliff. I have studied the final days of countless worlds… been through the memories of so many survivors… and I can say that The Entity doesn’t just corrupt and consume a world… it somehow taps into our collective fears and has a little fun.

But I cannot deny that all the stories and memories I’ve been examining suggest a voluntary and not involuntary will to create and destroy on the part of this Ancient.

He ignores the squeaks of the hamster. The flute's sound carries like chimes in the wind. With one final soul-piercing note, he smiles and opens his eyes. His classmates are huddled around the rodent, laughing with its every move. His teacher too.<br><br>He walks to the group. Students pass the hamster around as it squeaks incessantly. It finds itself directed into Ji-Woon's palm. He takes it in both hands. With one steady movement, he squeezes. A squeal. A slight crunch. No more sound. The children scream. Ji-Woon feels nothing.

Certain no one's watching, he jams a straightened coat hanger around the top of the window, pushing it through the other side. His thin fingers work quickly. Prior experience in breaking and entry pays off. He hooks the wire around the door lock and flicks it up. Without missing a beat, he slides inside, closes the door, and flattens himself along the backseat. He takes off his hoodie and sunglasses.<br><br>From his bag he pulls out rope, a blade, a dusty rag, and a bottle of chloroform. He waits. Takes out his earbuds. Listens to a song that's not his own. One he heard long ago.<br><br>He is eight years old. He sits on his father's shoulders, looking over a sea of human bodies. An elaborate stage is ahead, illuminated by colored spotlights. A man in gaudy, audacious clothing stands in front of a microphone. On each side is a guitarist, behind him, a drummer. A crash of sound. Beautiful, rhythmic music. A voice that twists delicately through the melody.<br><br>His father shouts something but he can't hear. Shouts again.<br><br>This is what you'll do. This is where your talent will take you.<br><br>He feels a tingle through his spine, and sees something incredible: everyone enraptured, focused intently on the sound of a single man. The emotion of thousands is guided by his voice. He is seen by all, he is loved, and he is wonderous.<br><br>Ji-Woon never played his flute again. He reveled in sounds that reached global audiences, attracted screaming fans, turned men and women into idols. His childhood fear vanished as he learned to divulge himself through the intricacy and pliability of pop, his inner thoughts riding atop soundwaves, fusing together with other genres—rock, hip hop, jazz, punk. It was the music that could deliver him the explosive fame he deserved, a promise that he would never be upstaged. He was no longer confined to his timid shell; he revealed himself through his mastery of music, poured his heart into sound. He became envied, lusted over, and respected for the hits that spilled from his lungs.<br><br>He takes the earbuds in his hands and smiles. How miraculous that a boy became a god. ",

But Lucas is late, and Ji-Woon wonders if the storm has altered plans.<br><br>He feels control slipping away, replaced by something else. It pushes against his chest. Forces him to gasp for air, heavy and sticky in his lungs. Everything's ruined. He claws his nails into the car seat, forces his mouth shut to keep himself from screaming.

Lucas grabs a handful of hair and pulls Ji-Woon forward, breaking the chokehold. He bites deep into Ji-Woon's wrist, drawing blood.

An anonymous post claims that the victim was last seen alive at the Trickster's VIP meet-up after his concert in New York early this year. Yun-Jin remembers that night. Not because of the concert, but because of a detail that has been replaying in her mind ever since. Bleeding scratch marks on the Trickster's forearms when he showed up at the concert’s afterparty. The rumors online were rekindling the suspicion she silenced before. <br><br>Years ago, the Trickster and she arrived in Miami several days earlier than planned. Yun-Jin attended networking events while the Trickster rehearsed. Three days following their arrival, a folksinger was found dead downtown, near the bar where he performed. A security footage was released to the public showing a man dressed in black with his face covered, leading the singer down an alley. The dark, blurry footage revealed little about the suspect. But Yun-Jin noticed a detail that twisted her stomach in knots. She recognized the gold rimmed headphones around the suspect’s neck with two large “Xs”, one for each ear. It was the brand-new model of the Xerxes 1050x headphones, which few audiophiles knew about and even fewer could afford. She recognized the model right away because the Trickster favored their equipment over other expensive models. He wore a similar pair on the plane to Miami, but then switched to a lesser model for the rest of the tour, which only fueled her doubts. <br><br>Back then, however, she was not in a good place. The death of NO SPIN was still fresh. Acute insomnia kept her mind in a haze and the jet lag of the tour only worsened her state. In the end, she decided to let the police do their job and focus on hers; producing music. But now someone else was dead, someone whom the Trickster might have been the last one to see alive. The headphones, the scratch marks, and the late-night outs were details, but they added up. <br><br>How many coincidences does it take to know? <br><br>A knock on the door makes her jump. The head of security is here. Yun-Jin follows her gut. She confronts him. She bluffs about firing the whole security crew if he does not come clean. It pays off. She learns that the Trickster left the hotel premises last night. His bodyguard tried to follow but lost him on the way. <br><br>Yun-Jin pounds her fist on the table. <br><br> Why would he leave the hotel? To go where?

If the Trickster is linked to a murder, so is she. Even if there is no evidence. Even if it’s just rumors. It’s her life on the line. Her entire career. She could never produce music again. And the worst part is… it's her own fault. She knows better than to trust someone in this industry.  <br><br>She needs to get answers, before it is too late. Whatever the Trickster is doing at night, she must find out. Her doubts won’t be quieted until she knows for certain.  ",

There are also many versions of Dejavuism that relate a story of how one man found a way into the darkest recesses of this dimension to save the one he loved. But the story doesn’t go into the details of how he managed to find a way in, and I will have to go through other versions of the story to see if there is any information that can help me. Better yet, I am hoping to find his actual memories within the fog to give me a sense of how he found a way into this realm.     ",

    "9831753642FA9BC6DA33908D274D765B": "Mahan Singh spent seventeen years amassing a fortune for his estranged niece by leading mercenary missions all over the world for Leviathon Securities. A decorated soldier in the Indian army, Mahan was discharged after thirteen years of service for disobeying orders while on assignment for the United Nations. Shortly afterward, he joined Leviathon and found himself on a series of strange assignments that involved securing haunted locations and procuring strange artifacts of an occult nature. Locations and artifacts that seemed worthless but were of grave importance to governments and organizations for some reason or another. Mahan didn't know what to make of it. To him, it all felt like a kind of invisible war between secret societies that were somehow able to use governments and corporations like pieces on a chessboard for a bunch of old, moldy books and geometric trinkets from forgotten civilizations.  \n\nNow Mahan was pinned behind a crumbling wall in a village in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya with his fallen unit scattered in pieces all over the surrounding dirt roads. He had been fighting all day against different units and was fresh out of luck and ammunition.   \n\nThere’s no way out of here, he told himself. I’ve got no support, no ammunition, no luck. Why do you need luck when you have a weapon and your wits? You’ve been in worse situations and survived. Think you are beaten and you are beaten. I am beaten. You are almost beaten, and that’s not the same thing.  \n\nSuddenly, Mahan heard the surrounding mercenaries yelling at one another in Russian. They were planning an attack and coordinating with one another. He peeked around the corner, then ducked fast as several rounds punched holes into the wall sending clouds of dust and stone into the air. He cursed in Punjabi, grabbed his automatic rifle, then craned his head ever so slightly to see fast-moving silhouettes against the full moon closing in on his position. Quickly, he crawled into a nearby home and hid the asset—the ancient scroll—underneath several corpses of British agents he had killed just before the Russians had decided to join their party. Then he hid in the shadows, holding his rifle by the barrel, refusing to die without a fight.  \n\nThey probably all work for The Collector, he told himself. Crazy rich man with too much time and money on his hands. Shah just wants to make sure he gets the scroll before another eccentric billionaire beats him to it. And from where does this prize come? It supposedly comes from a lost, elder civilization with advanced and forbidden knowledge. Nonsense, all of it. A bunch of ancient stories about pagan priests and barbaric rituals and cosmic deities told around a campfire. Ancient sci-fi, at best.  \n\nTaking a deep breath, Mahan heard their almost inaudible footfalls before he saw them. His eyes narrowed and his face hardened as two mercs entered the moonlit doorway. With a groan, he launched himself into the air, smashing the butt of his rifle against one head and then the other.  \n\nBoth mercs collapsed to the ground unconscious. A split-second later, Mahan yanked a loaded rifle from the hands of one of the fallen mercs and rushed through the doorway taking cover behind a well spilling over with thick buzzing flies like living black soup. Inside the well were the rotting bodies of those who had sought the scroll but had found death instead.    \n\nMahan buried his nose in his arm and suppressed an instinct to retch. Then, seeing a merc, he lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. Bullets tore holes through the neck and face as the mercenary staggered back and forth, then fell against a wagon with the pulpy head hanging by a shred of flesh.  \n\nAs he searched the shadows for other mercs, Mahan suddenly heard the crunch of stone behind him. He whirled to fire— \n\nA second too late.  \n\nSeveral rounds pounded into his Kevlar vest like a jackhammer, sending him stumbling backward into the black soup of death. A moment later the surviving mercs loomed over the mouth of the well as a thick black fog coiled around them like a snake.  \n\nTaking a deep breath, Mahan closed his eyes and waited for a death that never came. Instead of a report ripping though the darkness like a clap of thunder, he heard a scream followed by a cry and then shrieks of agony. When he opened his eyes, the mercs were gone as though they had been erased by the fog.   \n\nMahan struggled through the putrid blood and fluids to climb up and out of the well. As he pulled himself over the gore-covered mouth he noticed the world had been plunged into an abyss of fog. Before he could make any sense of what was happening, something snatched his ankle—hard—and tried to pull him back down.  \n\nDesperately, Mahan gripped the edge of the well and held on tightly. He looked to his feet where he saw multiple hands yanking and clutching at his legs. He held on for dear life but his hands slipped in the blood and gore and soon gave way.  With a terrible cry, he fell back into the gore as boney hands clawed at his legs, his arms, his throat, his beard, his nose, his turban and pulled him deeper and deeper into the darkness.  \n\nNeedless of pain burst inside his head as he drowned in thick, fermenting blood. He knew with a strange resignation that he was dying, or that he was already dead, and that he would never know his niece or what had become of her. After his wife and parents had died in a plane crash and his brother had disappeared, she was the only one left. She was his only family, and he swore he would always take care of her. \n\nBut then life happened, and in the end, he had only taken care of himself. He had lived a lonely, selfish life counter to his upbringing and his beliefs. He was a walking contradiction who had somehow convinced himself that he was cursed, that everyone he had ever loved died or disappeared, and that he was doing his niece a favor by staying out of her life. He had somehow convinced himself that he was keeping his bad luck away from her while he amassed a fortune that he would one day leave her.   \n\nBut Mahan knew it was all a lie. He didn’t know the first thing about nurturing and raising a human being. Raising his brother’s daughter terrified him and that’s why he had clung to any reason he could to abandon her. All he knew was killing and destroying in the name of governments and corporations. And as the darkness swallowed him whole, Mahan realized in horror that killing and destroying was all he would ever know.   \n\nMahan had failed his ancestors. He had failed his family. He had failed his brother and his niece. He would never know her hopes, her dreams, her likes, or dislikes… He would know nothing except the inky blackness that swept over his eyes and the unnamable terrors that awaited him in the great unknown.  \n\n \n\nMAHAN OPENED HIS EYES WITH A START. He was still in the well, submerged in the putrid, death stew, staring up at thick black fog drifting over him as he heard a whirring sound—the sound of a motor accelerating and decelerating somewhere in the distance. He took a moment to gather his senses. He didn’t remember much. He remembered being shot, stumbling back and falling into the well. Everything after that moment felt like a nightmare that had been inspired by one of his father’s stories—the one where unarmed, peaceful protestors were shot dead and stuffed into a well and left to rot in the blistering Punjab heat.  \n\nWith a painful groan, Mahan reached out with trembling hands to a jutting rock and, with difficulty, pulled himself free from the gore. Rock by rock, he climbed his way up the festering throat of the well and finally pulled himself over the mouth and into the thick black fog.  \n\nA cry sounded over the incessant whir of the machine and Mahan quickly realized he wasn’t in Kenya anymore. He stood and took in his surroundings. There were strange structures like factories submerged in the fog. Scattered around the structures were piles of clothes and bodies set ablaze. Above in the pale red sky crows circled and cawed adding to the oppressive cacophony.  \n\n“Help… please…” \n\nMahan heard a woman crying for help coming from a bank of fog. Snapping out of his daze, he extended his hands and waved a tunnel through the fog, searching for the source of the sound.   \n\n“Help… someone… please… ”  \n\nThe disembodied voice reached him again, and she somehow seemed close and far at the same time. He froze to listen carefully, but all he could hear was the incessant whirring of the motor accelerating and decelerating.  \n\n“Help…” \n\nThere it was again. He moved left, then right, and finally he reached a woman in pilot fatigues stuck in a trap of twisted barbed wire. Without a word, he pulled the metal thorns out of her legs as she winced and squirmed in pain with every movement. “I don’t know what happened or how I ended up here…” Her voice trailed away, and she seemed bewildered.  \n\n“What’s the last thing you remember?” Mahan asked as he struggled with the barbed wire.  \n\nThe pilot stumbled back and answered with intermittent groans as she nursed her wounds. “I was on patrol… soaring through clear blue skies… when this black cloud suddenly appeared… and then the plane began to shake and break apart and… I don’t know… I was here…” \n\nA sudden click and they both turned wide-eyed to face the barrel of a rifle. Behind the rifle a man in black fatigues appraised them. “Who the fuck are you two?” \n\nMahan raised a hand. “Wait! Careful… we’re not a threat. We’re just as confused as you.”  \n\n“Who are you and what are you doing in Texas? Are you CIA? Is this some kind of a test?” \n\nMahan gritted his teeth. “This ain’t a test. And I’m pretty sure this ain’t Texas.” \n\n“Who are you?!”  \n\nThe agent shoved his rifle in Mahan’s face. But before Mahan could answer a Japanese woman in a black and red kimono emerged from the fog, unsheathing a katana with a high-pitched ring. She yelled at them in Japanese, and Mahan extended a calming hand to her.  “Please… put the sword down…” He then turned to the agent. “Please… put the gun down… let’s figure this out. “ \n\n“Who are you!” the agent yelled, pushing the muzzle in Mahan’s face. “I won’t ask again!” \n\n“I can tell you who I am, but that’s not the question, is it?” \n\n“Yeah! What’s the question, then?” \n\n“Where?” Mahan said flatly, motioning to the destroyed factories, the craters and the smoldering piles of trash and bodies. “I should think the question is: Where? Where are we?” \n\nAnother voice came from behind. “He’s right, you know. “ \n\nMahan turned to watch a man with a police jacket emerge from the fog. “We’re still trying to figure that one out… but right now we should all be asking: How?” \n\n“How?” Mahan repeated.  \n\n“Yes,” the detective said. “How much time do we have before The Horror finds—” \n\nBefore he could finish his sentence, a shriek followed by and high-pitched whine startled them. A moment later a mass of melded humanity and machine came at them.   \n\nMahan could make out several heads all shrieking battle cries in different languages attached to a patchwork of charred scraps from missiles, tanks, fighter jets, and nuclear submarines all bearing flags and strange logos of brands from different periods he vaguely remembered. He stared at this monstrous chimera in shock and wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at.  \n\nThe Horror, he called it. Looks more like the embodiment of war—sponsored war.   \n\nMahan swallowed a thickness growing in his throat as The Horror rushed the stunned agent and tore his head off, swallowing the terrified face and dripping neck like a ripe cherry. Then its ghastly mouth opened wide and a stream of fire torched the jerking, headless corpse as it collapsed into a heap of industrial garbage.  \n\nNot waiting to be next, the samurai lunged at the monstrosity and, with incredible speed and precision, cut it to pieces. Then all of them watched in disbelief as the pieces of flesh and metal slowly disintegrated into the living fog.  \n\nThe detective sighed. “It will be back,” he said, appraising the samurai. “18th or 19th Century. Red Crown Clan. You’re not the first. We could definitely use your skills here.” \n\nThe samurai sheathed her katana and grasped at the fog as though trying to capture pieces of it to study—as though she recognized it.   \n\nMahan approached the detective. “Where exactly is here?”  \n\nBut the detective didn’t answer. He merely turned his back on them and walked away, saying, “Follow me… if you want to escape.” \n\nMahan took in a deep breath and gathered his senses. Then he took to his heels and followed the detective into the unknown with the samurai and the fighter pilot in tow.  \n\n \n\nMAHAN FOLLOWED THE DETECTIVE through a labyrinth of bombed-out factories and mountains of garbage set ablaze. At the center of this industrial hell was a giant machine with hooks and cameras and television screens of every possible brand and size broadcasting moments of Mahan’s life as though his brain was a Wi-Fi signal that could stream his memories—his darkest memories. And not just his memories, but the memories of the samurai, the pilot, and the detective. It was as though they had been selected by some unnamable and incompressible intelligence for mere entertainment.   \n\nThe detective stopped when he reached what seemed to be a submarine hatch surrounded by a pile of smoldering trash and mangled, charred bodies.  \n\n“Get in!” he yelled, opening the hatch. “I'll explain what I know when we’re safe.” \n\n“Where does it lead?” Mahan asked.  \n\n“Away from here,” the detective said. “And that’s all you should care about right now. We don’t have time for explanations. But when we’re safe, Ben will answer all your questions as best he can. Right now, you need to—” \n\nA clanking noise suddenly interrupted him. \n\n“Go, go, go!” The detective yelled as The Horror came at them from the shadows. Instantly, he pulled out his flashlight, distracting The Horror as Mahan and the others escaped down the hatch.  ",

Thick, smoky air stung her nose as she stepped over shards of glass and heaps of charred wood. Bright city lights spilled through the shattered windows and crumbling walls. Carefully, Haddie picked her way across the floor toward the elevator, where she found the door leading to the stairs. A sign on the door warned her that the entire structure would be demolished in the morning. \n\nThere’s still time, she thought, as she ascended the narrow stairs. I’ve got a few hours to convince Max that he’s not crazy, that he’s not losing his grip on reality and that something is happening to our world. Something only a few of us can see and feel.  \n\nHaddie reached the last door at the top of the stairs and pushed her way onto the roof. There she spotted a man sitting on the ledge with thick, tangled hair and a weathered army jacket, drinking himself to oblivion as he stared out at the bright lights of the city.  \n\nShe approached him slowly, and he didn’t react or even turn to regard her when she sat down beside him. She merely sat in silence, listening to the police sirens wail in the distance over the horns and the muffled music coming from the clubs and bars below. At last, she said, “I thought I’d find you here.”  \n\nMax took a few swallows of rum. “I don’t know you.”  \n\n“But I know you, Maxwell.” \n\n“I don’t care where you’re from. I don’t want to talk.” \n\n“Yes, I can see that. You want to drink.” \n\n“Perceptive,” he said sarcastically, then extended the bottle toward her. “You’re welcome to join.” \n\n“No, thank you, Mr. Holt.” \n\n“How do you know my name?” \n\n“I know much more about you, Max.” \n\n“You CIA? FBI?” \n\n“If I were, you’d already be dead,” Haddie said. “You were an Olympic Biathlon athlete. You were a soldier. Iraq. Syria. Afghanistan. You left the military after an incident and after that you kind of pulled yourself off the grid.”  \n\n“You know how to use a search engine. You get a gold medal. Now leave me alone to my quiet time.” Max raised the bottle and took another swig.  \n\nHaddie narrowed her eyes and looked to the shadows on the roof beyond him. She couldn’t see anything but she could hear disembodied voices talking to him. She shut them out, then leaned closer to him. “I know you see and hear things others can’t. I know they follow you. I know you want them to stop. And I didn’t get all that from a search engine.”  \n\nMax lowered the bottle from his lips and fixed his gaze on a couple arguing on the sidewalk below. “You don’t know what I hear… what I see…” \n\n“Things from another place. Another world. Another realm.” \n\nMax swallowed a growing lump in his throat.  \n\nHaddie paused, then continued: \n\n“Something otherworldly attacked your unit and you survived because of your abilities and now… no one believes a word of it. You were ridiculed, discharged and silenced with an endless supply of opioids to fog your memory and neutralize your questions.” \n\nHaddie stopped as his eyes filled with tears.  \n\n“You’re not crazy, Max. You saw what you saw, and no drug or drink in the world will relieve the guilt or stop the nightmares. And that’s why you’re here, isn’t it… Waiting for morning to make it all stop.” \n\nMax cleared his throat. “What do you want?” \n\n“Your skills and abilities on my team.” \n\n“And what team is that?” \n\n“The one that is trying to stop the end of the world.” \n\nMax laughed uproariously, then stopped at once. “You’re serious?” \n\nHaddie grabbed the bottle out of his hands, took a swig, handed it back to him and nodded gravely.  \n\nMax shook his head. “What do you know about what happened to my unit?”   \n\n“Not much,” Haddie admitted. “What I do know is there are some very powerful people who have the answers or think they have the answers you’re looking for. What I do know is that since I was a teen I’ve been caught in the crossfire between two warring groups that need people like us to access this other realm and bring things back. I’ve been running from them for the last forty years, and I have helped others like us from suffering an unknown fate at their cruel hands.” \n\nMax’s face hardened. “They laughed at me. They said something in me snapped and that I had imagined the fog and the creatures that came out of it.” \n\nHaddie shook her head. “You didn’t imagine anything. I lost my brother in the same way.” \n\nThey exchanged a look.  \n\n“He’s not dead… I can still hear him… I do… but I can’t see him…” \n\n“Where is he?” \n\nHaddied shrugged. “I don’t know. All I know is we’re not the only ones who lost friends and loved ones to this phenomenon. And if we work together we might one day see them again.”  \n\nMax laughed and pulled on his bottle. “So you’re recruiting me? Is that what you’re doing? Recruiting me in some kind of paranormal army.” He laughed, again in disbelief.   \n\nHaddie watched him laugh. “I’m giving you what you need.” \n\n“And what is that?” \n\n“A second chance,” Haddie answered flatly. “Purpose. Meaning. A chance to save others from being murdered or used by the same assholes who are coming for you right now as we speak.” \n\nMax laughed. “What are you talking about? Who’s coming for me?” \n\n“I have a list—” \n\nHaddie broke off abruptly. She pulled out a gun from her jacket and shot two dim figures in the head as they emerged from the exit door. She then jerked to her feet and hurried to the bodies, searching their jackets for IDs without any success. “They’ll be more,” she said, looking up at Max as he stepped beside her with wide, confused eyes. “You’re at the top of their list and that’s why I’m here.”  \n\n“What list? What are you talking about?” \n\n“Follow me,” Haddie said. “And I’ll explain everything.”  \n\nMax nodded, dropped his bottle with a loud clang, and followed Haddie down the stairs, through the charred building, and out into the ally where a cab was waiting for them.  \n\n \n\nMAX HOLT STOOD IN THE BASEMENT of the Park & Sherwood bookstore examining a wall of pictures, notes and numbers covered by a web of red string highlighting connections. He narrowed his gaze on hundreds if not thousands of missing people from all over the world. Tacked between the pictures and notes were transcripts of horror stories from various podcasts decoded into numbers and coordinates. He then glanced around the room and noticed artifacts and artwork from ancient civilizations he did not recognize from any history book he had ever read, and he had read many. He turned back to the wall and noticed for the first time a picture of his unit in Afghanistan among countless other units that were missing in action. His face grew stern, his eyes narrowed, and he turned to Haddie and asked, “Is this the list?” \n\nHaddie stepped beside him. “This is the list of those we failed.” Her eyes fixed on a picture of her brother at a World War Two zeppelin crash site in the French Alps where they had recovered several “Wunder Weapons” that a secret unit of German soldiers was transporting for the Thule Society. It was the last time she had seen him before he had disappeared. “The list is of those that are being targeted by some very powerful and disturbed elites. They will either be killed in ritual sacrifice, or they will be used as tools to search areas that overlap with another dimension.” \n\n“I don’t understand.” \n\n“I know it’s a lot to take in. But these groups… they communicate through random podcasts and deliver encoded messages in stories and media. And we do our best to decode them.” \n\nMax scoffed. “Is this some kind of joke? Codes in stories… That’s your list?” \n\nHaddie shook her head. “This is real. There are people who are in serious danger, and you can help them. You left the government because they laughed and ridiculed you. That won’t happen with us. We know what you saw is real.”  \n\nMax approached the picture of his unit.  \n\n“I’ve got names and places and endless funds at my disposal,” she said. “We’re twelve to midnight, and only a few of us know it, and I need you on our team, not theirs.” \n\n“Minutes?”  \n\n“Seconds. Twelve seconds.” \n\n“These groups,” Max queried. “Are they that powerful?” \n\n“You have no idea.” \n\nMax extended his hand, touching the picture of his unit. He then followed a red string to a passage culled from a horror story. From the passage, he followed yet another string to a series of numbers—the time, day and place the creatures in the fog attacked them.  \n\nHaddie stepped away and soon returned with a folder, pulling out a picture of an abandoned cemetery in Chile along with a picture of a man. She handed the pictures to Max, and he stared at them for a long, thoughtful moment before nodding that he would join her team.  ",

    "FEF9005C483A18B13B79B2BA66F81011": "Several paths lead to the harbor where peasants and merchants had witnessed the strange arrival of a foreign ship. They discussed the ship and the arrival in the surrounding villages with mingled anger, fear and curiosity. Most believed the foreigners were here to disseminate contraband and rob their beloved land of precious artifacts. Many believed a band of thieves was selling these precious goods to these foreigners in exchange for their weapons. Some even claimed that they had seen these thieves on the gangway, loading stolen artifacts and relics from fallen lords and noble families onto their ship.   \n\nSaku Nakano stood in the moonlight, considering her options. There was the long and safe route along the dirt road, and there were shorter routes through the dark and deadly woods where many unlucky villagers had been killed by creatures—it was said—not of this world.  \n\nSaku knew of these cursed places all too well. She had lost her entire clan to these mist-enshrouded areas over the years and now she roamed the country—the last of The Red Crown Clan—seeking out the great corruption that was upon her people, finishing what her clan had started centuries ago.  \n\nThe enemies to her clan, The Black Serpent Society, served a nine-headed serpent made of black mist. They believed the black serpent would grant them powers and boons beyond human comprehension in this world and the next in exchange for unquestioning devotion. They were convinced that the black-mist serpent was a demon that slithered through these wooded cursed areas creating doorways into what they called The Belly of the Serpent, or just, The Belly.  \n\nSaku turned toward the dark woods, and sensing raw evil in her midst, she prepared to enter, thinking about the hushed conversations she had overheard in the nearby markets. She remembered the merchant hacking and gutting fish as he talked to a woman who was going through a bag of oysters she had just gathered in the sea. She remembered them talking about how they had seen bandits with pistols and gunpowder and other strange weapons.  \n\nI remember them mentioning the foreigners, she thought. They said they were Dutchmen. They were on the wharf speaking fluent Japanese with unknown merchants in plain kimonos with the exception of a strange serpent crest. They described the crest as a nine-headed serpent twisted in a circular knot as it chased its nine tails. They described only a few sailors and how most of the crew had perished of an unnamed disease during the voyage across the ocean. \n\nA sudden laugh interrupted her thoughts.  \n\n“Where is your husband? “  \n\nA man in a plain brown kimono looked her up and down in the pearly light of the moon as he approached her.  \n\nSaku met his gaze but did not react or respond. \n\nThe man placed his hand lightly on the hilt of his sword as he continued to appraise her. She was tall and lean with strong, sinuous arms and piercing dark eyes. She had long, black oiled hair gathered in a perfect queue, doubled over and tied neatly with a red and white sash. She wore thong sandals and a simple black kimono. A vibrant red sash around her waist held two scabbard swords. One sword was short and straight, the other was long and curved at the tip. \n\n“Where are your papers?”  \n\nThe man edged closer to her with dim recognition in his eyes. He had heard rumors of an Onna-Musha in a black and red kimono roaming the land, destroying the wicked while protecting those who could not protect themselves. Or did she roam the land seeking justice for her butchered clan? Or was she a bandit leader who raided and pillaged villages?  \n\nThe man couldn’t quite remember what he had heard, and he had forgotten the name people had given her. It was related to her clan and its origin. That much he knew, but not much more. It would have helped if he had paid closer attention when his wife had been discussing her many adventures with her sisters. \n\nBut he had ignored most of the stories as exaggerated gossip and legends not unlike that other samurai that everyone called a demon. There was no such thing as a demon samurai and there was certainly no such thing as a woman samurai that could perform all the feats the stories claimed she had performed.  \n\nSaku breathed deeply and placed her hand near the hilt of her long sword.  \n\n“Do you not see I am addressing you! Where are your papers! Answer me wo—” \n\nWith impossible speed, Saku whirled her sword in a gleaming silver arc and the man’s torso toppled off his hips and a fountain of warm crimson fed the ground. The twisted mouth twitched as it sputtered bile and blood and tried to make out the words, “Redcrane.”  \n\nHe had remembered— \n\nA moment too late.  \n\nReturning her sword to its scabbard, Saku sighed and said an inward prayer for the brute.  Then she stepped over his jerking torso and entered The Belly of the Serpent.  \n\n \n\nWITH CAREFUL, SILENT STEPS, Saku pushed smoothly through The Belly, paying close attention to the lurking black mist slithering through gnarled trees that seemed to shift and waver with her every step, as though to intimidate her.  \n\nDon’t make a sound, she thought, stepping down a slope through noiseless shadows toward the sound of waves crashing against rocks. She was close to the wharf. She could smell the seaweed, fish and salt in the air.  \n\nThere was also something else.   \n\nA strange heaviness in the atmosphere.   \n\nStaring up through the shaking canopy, she saw thick clouds marching across the sky. She sensed the floor moving, and looked down to see her legs completely submerged in the creeping mist. A moment later a branch cracked not ten paces away, and she knew she wasn’t alone anymore.  \n\nSaku neither ran nor hid. She froze, closed her eyes, listening carefully for threats approaching through the black mist that heaved and moved as though it were alive.  \n\nSaku knew she was somehow—as difficult as it was to explain—in two worlds at once. And she knew there were demons and monsters in the other world that hunted within these overlapping areas.   \n\nSaku didn’t know much about this other world. What she knew she had learned from her mother and father. The Black Serpent Society—they had once explained—believed the black-mist serpent was a living deity that consumed people, towns, civilizations and worlds.  \n\nThe Black Serpent Society believed that within The Belly there was lost knowledge and power from all these consumed worlds that could help them usher in a golden age of peace, prosperity and abundance. Their dedication, their devotion, their ritualistic killings were, in the end, for the betterment of humanity.  \n\nThe Red Crown Clan, however, believed the promise of a golden age was nothing more than a cosmic ruse—a shiny gold lure to snag minnows, fish and whales in the abyss.    \n\nWith a deep breath, Saku sensed the threats were gone. She opened her eyes and continued through wavering light and shadow as the wind began to pick-up and the mist grew thicker.  But then she stopped suddenly when she heard a familiar roar.  \n\nA thunderous roar that seem to shake the world.  \n\nThis time she didn’t close her eyes.  \n\nShe didn’t run.  \n\nThis time she silently lowered herself by a tree as she heard the pounding footfalls of a giant samurai in shiny green and gold armor approaching. She heard him smashing bushes and trees with his kanabo as he searched for her in the shadows. She knew without seeing him that she was being hunted by the samurai that had been corrupted and turned into a demon by the Black Mist Serpent.  \n\nHer sister had told her many tales about this samurai. How he had once been a man of honor and conviction. How he had hunted and executed corrupt merchants and false samurai. How peasants and villagers began calling him a demon because of his savage methods. And how he had ultimately been turned into the very thing he hated most, the very thing the stories depicted him as— \n\nThe Oni Samurai.  \n\nThe very same Oni her sister savagely battled long ago when they had been caught in the mist. She had escaped, her sister hadn’t and now all she wanted to do was take down this demon and make him tell her where she was.  \n\nBut Saku knew better than to lose herself in the past. She pushed the memory of her sister out of her thoughts and instantly found her focus. She looked through a gap in the trees toward the wharf, where she saw orange specs of light against the wall of darkness that was the sea. She could make it. She could outrun him to a place where he could not follow.   \n\nLooking over her shoulder, Saku saw the giant samurai only ten paces away. He was decked in shiny gold and green armor, and carried around his back a massive leather bag dripping, thick blood at the bottom. A few heads jutted out of the bag and clouds of buzzing flies surrounded him.   \n\nThe Oni searched the trees and bramble and was now only seven paces away. Unexpectedly, something jerked away from a bush and he launched at the creature and smashed it with his kanabo, losing his bag in the attack. The bag fell and dozens of heads rolled toward her.  \n\nOne head stopped at her feet and stared at her with wide open eyes.  \n\nSaku gasped as she suddenly realized she was staring at her own face. She fixed her gaze at the other heads in the mist and thought that they all seemed to resemble her, as though this demon samurai had already decapitated her countless times before.  \n\nNone of it made sense. \n\nImpossible, she thought. It cannot be. And yet… it is… Have I fallen to the demon before? Are there others like me in the demon world that made him? But look… a scar!  \n\nSaku observed the head at her feet and noticed a long scar on the side of her face. She instinctively felt her own cheek where the scar should have been. It was proof that this was someone else, though she could not deny the resemblance was uncanny.  \n\nSaku swatted flies and reached for the head to get a closer look, but then she suddenly froze when she heard a terrifying roar not five paces behind her. In one fluid motion she dove into a thicket as the kanabo missed its mark. Without a moment to spare, she scrambled to her feet and turned just in time to see a gore-covered kanabo with the crushed head of a rabbit coming down on her with devastating speed.  \n\nQuickly, she sidestepped and withdrew her sword. An instant later she slashed off the demon’s arm with a roar of her own. But knowing the arm would grow back in the mist, she turned and charged away, desperately running for the beach. She had downed the demon before, but somehow it always managed to rise unscathed to continue the hunt.  \n\nThere was no defeating the demon.  \n\nThere was only one option: escape.  \n\nAs she rushed through the woods, she turned back to see the demon chasing after her. She pushed herself to run faster and faster, and just as the demon lunged at her again, she dove out of the mist through a break in the trees to a place he could not follow.  \n\nThe demon samurai stopped suddenly and watched her closely.  \n\nSaku clambered to her feet, brushing off sand, seaweed and salt. She turned to face the edge of the woods where she saw red glowing eyes fade into the night. Then she heard the crunch of rocks behind her followed by a clicking sound. She turned slowly to face the barrel of a musket pistol glinting in the moonlight. ",

    "94D7A98F409F5A7B46ED0882C306BDFA": "SAKU LOOKED BEYOND THE PISTOL to a man in a dark kimono and short black hair. He inched closer to her with a smile, but she did not move nor give him the satisfaction of flinching. She met his gaze and edged back slightly. Then she stared off in the distance where she could see shadows moving about a cluster of abandoned homes near the wharf. The small village had been abandoned, no doubt, due to its proximity to the woods and the creatures that lurked within the mist.    \n\nThe man cleared his throat and placed the barrel inches from her face.  \n\nSaku stared into his eyes without fear or concern. She looked down at his sandals and back to his eyes. “Move!” he ordered, his ignorant smile widening. “I know who—” \n\nA sudden flash of moonlight and his head toppled off his shoulders before he could finish his sentence.  \n\nSaku watched the headless body spray warm blood into the cool night as it jerked left and right and finally collapsed into a mound of shells and seaweed, startling a nervous crab that instantly scuttled away into the gloom of night.  \n\nSaku gripped her sword and patiently picked her way through the jagged rock formations to reach the small village where Black Serpent brutes guarded the area against anyone who might try to interfere with their dark rituals and secret trade negotiations.  \n\nShe moved silently through the shadows, following the edge of a home. She froze when she heard footsteps approaching. She slowly placed her back against the wall and waited. She peeked around the corner and saw two thugs telling stories about the demon samurai.   \n\nShe crouched slightly, then, like a mighty tigress, she leaped into the air and thrust her sword through the two heads. They jerked violently then collapsed when she pulled her sword from their skulls.  \n\nShe took a moment to survey the area, then made her way noiselessly to the wharf where three thugs laughed and made jokes about the strange red alcohol the foreigners had shared with them.   \n\nShe held her sword firm, and she started toward them, practically gliding with quick, smooth steps. Just as one brute turned to meet her focused gaze she lunged with blinding speed and— \n\nThree headless bodies suddenly staggered stupidly in the dark and collapsed into each other with arterial blood spraying darkness against the bright light of the moon.  \n\nWiping warm blood off her face, she climbed a series of crates, moved past a clump of fishing nets, and crouched by the gangplank. She listened carefully for movement and heard steps just above in the ship.  \n\nWhen the footsteps receded to silence, she moved stealthily up the gangplank and halted, scanning the ship, spotting one thug sitting crossed-legged on a crate. Beside him were several other crates bearing the VOC logo and name of the Dutch East India Company.   \n\nCarefully, Saku embarked on the ship and moved toward the brute. But just as she prepared to pounce, she heard a click, followed by a high-pitched wheeling sound. It took her less than a moment to understand she had been lured into a trap—less than a moment too late.  \n\nBefore Saku had time to react, she felt the heaviness of a net collapse over her as dozens of thugs surrounded her with dirty looks and curses. She then watched the sitting thug, the leader of the group, turn to face her.  \n\nThe leader smiled, stood briskly, and laughed. “We thought you might show up?” he said as he approached her. He made a quick wave with his hand, and the thugs instantly trained musket pistols on her. “You’ve been quite busy interfering with our good work.”  \n\nShe didn’t respond, but she pushed and pulled against the net to gauge its strength. She glared at him as she realized this was no chance ambush. The Black Serpent Society had been tracking her and had somehow managed to trap her. The leader shook his head at her.  \n\n“Your clan is destroyed. Your weapon is irrelevant and outdated. You’re outnumbered and trapped and still you think you can do the impossible.” \n\nThis will be difficult, she thought. But not impossible. I’ve been in worse situations and survived.     \n\nSaku inched closer to the leader as he smiled at her. She believed his reluctance to shoot her was evidence that they wanted her alive for one of their rituals.  \n\nThe leader motioned to all the thugs and laughed, again.  \n\nSaku gritted her teeth and studied the thugs as they slowly closed in on her from every direction. She looked into the leader’s thieving dark eyes and saw all the lies and treachery of the Black Serpent Society. Then, looking beyond his eyes, she visualized herself triumphing against her enemy, leaping from thug to thug, cutting them down with her sword like weeds.  \n\nSuddenly, the leader barked orders, snapping her back to reality. The thugs inched closer to her with hideous smiles and wide, nervous eyes.  \n\n“Surrender willingly,” the leader said flatly. “And we will reunite you with your clan—as misguided as they may have been.”  \n\nSaku understood his meaning.  \n\nHe believed their rituals would open a doorway into the nameless realm where they were supposedly trapped and cursed to live out an endless cycle of life and death for reasons beyond comprehension.   \n\nSaku didn’t know what to believe. What she did know was that she wouldn’t allow these thugs the satisfaction of serving her on a sacrificial platter to the darkness they served and she had promised to destroy. She had made an oath long ago as a member of the Red Crown Clan to cleanse the world of the reeking corruption that was the Black Serpent Society, and she planned to honor that oath.  \n\nWith the strength and power of her ancestors coursing through her veins, Saku instantly rushed forward, her hand thrusting through the net. Powerful fingers grabbed the leader by the scruff of his kimono and pulled him in. Then, using him as a human shield, she whirled as pistols fired and balls ripped through his belly, chest and skull.    \n\nThrough the rising smoke from the pistols, Saku could see the thugs trying to reload. Without a moment to lose, she tossed her busted and shredded shield to the ground, and, with difficulty, she sliced through the net with her sword. A moment later, she was a hurricane of death and destruction, leaping from thug to thug as her hissing blade painted the deck red.  \n\nThe thugs didn’t know what to do. They were too stunned to react. It was like fighting a ghost, a monstrous shadow, a formless mist with swords for claws. Their futile attempts to parry her attacks with pistols met empty air as limbs fell and heads rolled.  \n\nIt was a horrible nightmare, as if by some strange, ironic twist of fate the Redcrane actually drew her power from the black mist serpent so that she was somehow a servant of the very darkness she had sworn to eliminate.   \n\nWhen the last thug fell with a gasp, Saku found herself surrounded by blood and carnage. She took in the stench of gunpowder as her gaze slowly lowered to a thug groveling like a maggot. She had sliced his legs at the knees and he was crawling away with nervous elbows that slipped with every move in the growing pool of blood.  \n\nWiping the gore off her face and kimono, she blocked his path and crouched to face him. The thug looked up at her with widening eyes. A bleat of terror rose from his throat that rose to a shrill pitch as she raised her sword and ended his service to the Black Serpent Society.   \n\nSaku rose slowly, and searching the ship, spotted a cluster of oil lamps glowing and flickering atop a crate. With focused determination, she picked her way through the bodies and kicked the crate, sending the oil lamps scattering to the wooden deck below.  \n\nThe lamps spat liquid fire and set the deck and lifeboat ablaze. Then, walking away from the burning ship, Saku considered everything she had just experienced.  \n\nTrapped. How did they know she was coming for them? How could she have taken the bait? How had she been lured so easily?  \n\nEnough. Warriors do not waste time with what ifs and what they should have or could have done. What matters now is the present and taking the next right step.  \n\nWhere to now? \n\nShe couldn’t think straight.  \n\nDespite all her training, a flame of anger burst in Saku for her careless mistake. Yet, she repressed her frustration and knew there was no use for it. Anger would only cloud her judgment and waste her time. She needed to keep her composure because—  \n\nHer friends and family could not have perished in vain. Because she was the last of her clan. Because the Black Serpent Society had to be stopped. Because she the hope of all those who believed she would end the darkness that was upon their land. Because she was— \n\nThe Redcrane. ",

    "741959E74423E5C84A57DF9AB1DDF96E": "It was a book club, and they were arguing over the latest Edwin Cain novel along with the interview the author had given where he discussed a concept he had called Dejavuism. He put forward the theory that our brains are biological, quantum computers with vast networking abilities beyond our current understanding of physics. Cain believed that our quantum brains could connect to other beings with similar frequencies within the multiverse as though they were inter-dimensional cellphones. The club members, who discussed these theories and how they sometimes felt their inner voice was another version of themselves advising them from another time or place, began telling stories about instincts, gut feelings, and deja-vu experiences that felt all too real. There was one skeptic who scoffed at the idea of the multiverse. He thought the idea was ridiculous comic book nonsense, and he laughed at the very notion that our brains were interconnected, multidimensional computers that received or projected ideas from the ether.  \n\nOne woman exclaimed:  \n\n“It could be true. Such a theory would help us understand why ideas seem to come to us as a group, or why so many similar ideas seem to bubble up all over the world at pretty much the same time. Who’s to say we aren’t all tapping into the same stream of ideas.” \n\nThe skeptic answered: \n\n“It’s just coincidence. That’s all it is when a bunch of people from different places come up with similar ideas. And coincidence has nothing to do with the multiverse or other versions of ourselves in the universe.” \n\nAnother man shook his head and said: \n\n“I don’t really agree. There’s shit out there we just don’t understand, and I recently read the idea for Wi-Fi and cellphones came from a bunch of scientists trying to understand a gland in our brain. A gland that’s bioluminescent and seems to be searching for signals. Granted this could be online misinformation, but what is true, and what many cultures believe is that our artists can tap into things not of this world. What I found interesting was how Cain said these visions that artists receive are only accessible to those who experience trauma when they’re young, those who have been bullied, abused, exiled… those who have learned to shut out their reality for self-protection in order to fully experience other realities.” \n\nA woman added:  \n\n“The door to the physical world closes, the door to another world opens.” \n\nThe skeptic laughed and was just about to speak when another woman, an aspiring storyteller, interrupted him and said: \n\n“I get visions and dreams about the same place all the time. One of my recurring dreams is of Romulus and how he is taken up by a massive black storm cloud and brought to this dark realm where he’s chased by a hideous creature… a monster that could not possibly exist. What’s strange is he’s not alone. He’s not the only being hunted. He’s with a biker and two other Scottish men who at first I thought were sailors, but then I had this other dream that showed me that they were, in fact, lighthouse keepers. I did some research and I could swear by the pictures that the biker I was seeing was Yui Kimura, the one who disappeared a few years ago.” \n\nThe skeptic laughed and said: \n\n“So what your saying is the Emperor of Rome wasn’t assassinated by his generals but is somehow stuck in some kind of demented world with Yuri Kimura and two lighthouse keepers. This, you somehow believe, is real. Romulus and Yui are running from a monster as we sip coffee and tea in our cozy chairs and talk books and authors. This is what you’re putting forward as something possible? Something reasonable for all of us to believe?” \n\nA woman said: \n\n“It sounds a bit out there. But maybe there are things in the cosmos that are beyond reason or science.” \n\nAnother woman beamed at the aspiring storyteller and said: \n\n“Real or not, you should write a story for your blog or even for your next performance. I think it would be a lot of fun, even if it does require a little suspension of disbelief.” \n\nThe aspiring storyteller smiled and answered: \n\n“Actually, I have a draft I’ve been working on, which I wanted to share with the group before I posted it. I’m still not sure if it’s a story I can perform because it’s a bit complicated and messy, but maybe you can help me find ways to energize and simplify it.” \n\nEveryone nodded enthusiastically, except for the skeptic who rolled his eyes.  \n\nThe storyteller pulled out a coffee stained notebook and opened it to a story that she still hadn’t titled. She took a deep, calming breath and began: \n\n“This story doesn’t have a title but I’m thinking of calling it The Tragedy of Cliff and Alex, who were real people and who disappeared before most of us were born. Now, I’m not one to believe in conspiracy theories or urban legends but their story, which I acquired through extensive interviews and research opened my mind to the possibility that there is more to our lives than that which can be seen or proven.” \n\nThe skeptic quipped: \n\n“Well, that’s convenient, isn’t it?” \n\nThe storyteller ignored his comment and continued:  \n\n“Love, for example, exists and ceases to exist just as soon as we indulge in proofs and evidence. As soon as there is doubt… as soon as there is a need for proof… love is dead. And yet, we know love is a real. And we know—don’t we—that love is quite unreasonable. It’s powerful. It’s maddening. And we hate that we can’t define it. Love exists, and it doesn’t need to be proven in any way, shape or form for it to be real—” the storyteller made an exaggerated gesture to grab something in the empty air—”And yet, just as soon as you try to grasp it—it tatters at the touch. \n\n“Cliff Barra always loved horror movies. He started making scary movies when his father bought him his first Super 8 camera. And so it comes to no surprise that he grew up to be a famous director who translated his favorite gothic novels and horror stories to the silver screen. It’s also no surprise that when he met Alex Damaro, an equally famous art director known for his brilliant and visionary production sets and costume designs, that they were instantly smitten with one another. Together, it`s safe to say, they produced some of the scariest and most iconic films to date. But all this changed when Alex suddenly disappeared while on set in a rolling cloud of black fog the crew insisted they had not designed.  \n\n“From that point on, the movies stopped. A great heaviness came over Cliff as he found himself confronted by the horror that he would never see Alex again. He turned his back on his friends, his career, his life, and he became possessed by an obsession to find out what had happened to Alex. Investigations into this strange fog led him to a group of people searching for missing loved ones. With this group he learned about the existence of secret cults and societies that understood the black fog and the strange realm from which it came. He dug deeper and deeper, discovering his old movie set wasn’t haunted as everyone said it was… but was… a kind of doorway to another realm. So he returned to the haunted movie set where Alex disappeared and waited… and waited… He waited for days until finally he heard Alex’s laughter, and with the laughter came the fog. And the fog rolled in and carried him away.  \n\n“And so, Cliff ended up in another world that defied his wildest nightmares. He followed Alex’s voice through a darkness that had never known the light of day. At last, he came upon a forest of wooden stakes bearing skewered heads. He picked his way through the stakes, inspecting each head. The scene reminded him of one of the first films he had made as a teenager. He soon came to one head that resembled an old producer friend of his. Suddenly, the eyes sprang open, and Cliff started. At once, all the heads came alive, taunting and ridiculing him like he had been ridiculed as a child for his passions and hobbies.  \n\n\"But Cliff stayed the course despite the insults and the taunts that he would never see Alex again. One head of the thousands shouted louder than the rest. The head screamed that Alex was being corrupted and that he should turn back before it was too late. Realizing this severed head knew more than the rest, Cliff kicked the stake and caught the head as it toppled off. The head protested and yelled that it had once been a king and it didn’t want to be in the hands of a commoner. And Cliff promised the king he would release him after—and only after—he helped him find Alex.  \n\n“Long story short, the head lead Cliff to the edge of a massive gate that surrounded a town that resembled every production set Alex had ever designed for Cliff. Before he could take in the area, he suddenly heard Alex screaming in the distance. The king warned Cliff not to interfere with the process and explained that Alex was being twisted and tortured into a brutal, murdering monster for reasons they would never understand.   \n\n“But Cliff couldn’t bear to hear Alex suffer. Every agonizing scream was a dagger in his heart. And so, dropping the head, he climbed over the gate and, unperturbed by the formless creatures moving in the fog, he followed the cries to the top of a castle he recognized from his Frankenstein film. Cliff charged up the winding stairs to the roof, where he found Alex agonizing on a metal table as bolts of lightning struck him every few moments from a thick, black storm cloud. All around him in glass prisons filled with formaldehyde were all the monsters Alex had ever designed since he was a child. Cliff couldn’t believe what he wasn’t seeing. It was as if this living nightmare were all a projection of their combined memories.  \n\n“Cliff didn’t even try to understand what was happening or what he was experiencing. Without hesitation, he rushed up to Alex not knowing what to do. In the shadows he spotted an ax on the cobblestone floor and instantly grabbed it. Then, despite the deadly lightning, he pushed through the sizzling and sparking pain to smash the chains that bound Alex to the table. Alex opened his half-conscious eyes with difficulty. He barely recognized Cliff. Alex squinted with charred eyelids and managed to murmur words that made Cliff smile. Then Cliff hefted Alex over his shoulders and charged down the stairs and out into the thickening fog where frantic, formless creatures did all they could to prevent them from escaping.  \n\n“Cliff kicked, punched and charged through the fog, smashing through creatures, crows, and claws—everything and anything the world set against him. He remembered the king telling him something about a hatch—the hatch would somehow lead to freedom. Desperately, Cliff searched the ground as he heard a roar followed by a clap of thunder. Pounding steps chased him through the darkness. He didn’t even bother to look back. He rushed forward until he saw it! The glint of metal by a crumbling Gargoyle statue from one of his movies. He ran to the hatch, opened it, and lowered Alex to safety. Then, just as he was about to descend, something sharp like talons clutched his ankles and pulled him screaming into the raging fog!  \n\n“I’d like to say that it all worked out in the end and that they lived happily ever after. But that’s not the truth of this story. The truth is Cliff took Alex’s place at the torturer’s table and was turned into a perfect champion of horror with little or no memory of who he was or how he ended up in this dark realm. And Alex… well… He ended up with a group of stranded souls who did whatever they could just to survive. But that’s another story for another time. Suffice to say that love torments all—bringing the best and worst out of us when we least expect it.”  \n\nThe storyteller finished and everyone was silent and inward, thinking about what they had sacrificed for love and what they would sacrifice for love. But not the skeptic. No, the skeptic was turning the story over and over in his head searching for issues. At last, he broke the silence, asking: \n\n“What happened to the head? The talking head? Cliff just drops the king’s head and then you never hear about it again. It kind of makes the story incomplete.” \n\nA woman blurted out: \n\n“Who cares about the damn head? It’s a love story!” \n\nThe skeptic added: \n\n“Also, I don’t think you can use 'tatters' as a verb.” \n\nThe storyteller smiled and politely said: \n\n“I’m still working the story, and the ideas are still coming to me in my dreams. I’ve been logging them in my notebooks and I’ll re-read the current version more critically to see if I need to do something else with the talking head.” \n\nAnother woman said: \n\n“All that horror, and for what? To end up twisted and tortured and turned into some abomination worse than anything he ever filmed. I feel so bad for him.” \n\nA man said: \n\n“I don’t. Not because I don’t like him as a character, but because that’s just the kinda things we do for love—the horrible and the beautiful, the bitter and the sweet, the euphoria and the madness—” he lost himself in a memory for a moment—”Love twists and torments. And I’m sure there’s nothing that dark world can do to anyone that would surpass the torment of not knowing what had happened to a loved one… or worse… the regret of knowing what had happened and not doing anything.” \n\nAnother man said: \n\n“Well, I do hope you publish this story on your blog. I found it heartbreaking and terrifying… and I guess I’m wondering if you really think this is what happened to the real Cliff and Alex.” \n\nThe storyteller shrugged and closed her notebook as she prepared to leave. She wasn’t sure what she believed anymore.  \n\nThe skeptic laughed and said: \n\n“I’ll tell you what I think. I think the real Cliff and Alex faked their disappearance to get out of the limelight, and they moved far, far away to some gorgeous, exotic island where they’re eating grapes, drinking margaritas, and living happily ever after.” \n\nThe man said: \n\n“Well, I do hope you’re right and the story is just a story.  But if you’re not… well… I hope Alex will one day be able to do for Cliff what Cliff did for him.” \n\nA woman said: \n\n“It kind of makes you wonder if the characters we read about in the books are actually real somewhere.” \n\nAnother woman said:  \n\n“A story in this world, reality in another.”   \n\nThe storyteller stood, smiled at all the book club members, and excused herself as she had an early shift at the café. Everyone said goodbye, watched her disappear out the door, and then returned to their discussion about Edwin Cain, Dejavuism, and the story they had just heard. ",

She must continue John’s work as Jigsaw, the successor. Amanda reaches for the folder in his hands. Let me show you what I can do.  \n\nJohn’s tired eyes stare at Amanda, who holds his gaze firmly. She is ready and they are running out of time. \n\nHe nods reluctantly.  ",

Earlier today, she broke into Grace’s inbox to find her flaw. The test must be perfect. Perhaps John will be able to rest once he is convinced that his life's work is in capable hands. \n\nAmanda pores over a series of documents and emails exchanged between Grace and a lawyer from ten years ago. A certain Ben Fairfax threatened to expose a scandal relating to when Grace joined the city council. The lawsuit was settled swiftly.  \n\nBut the emails continued between Grace and her lawyer. Amanda found a report showing that Zanix industries, a copper exporter in the area, poured waste directly into the Hillford river, contaminating the ground water. The city's decayed, century-old water lines were unable to filter the filth. Grace covered up the lawsuit to avoid adding to the city’s increasing taxes. For ten years, filth has been poured into the water of Grace’s oblivious voters.  \n\nAmanda looks down at the glass of water sitting on her desk.  \n\nShe dumps it into the sink and grabs a bottle of vodka from the freezer. Icy bitterness rolls off her tongue, hitting her palate with an herbal kick. Not an ideal way to hydrate, but safer than Hillford tap water.  \n\nOn the television, confetti are falling on Grace’s smooth brown hair. The polls are in, and Grace Wright has been elected as mayor.",

While examining the vast tunnel network, another thought crosses her mind. Soon, Gideon will be her domain. A thrilling sensation of alarm and excitement follows that thought.   \n\nHer flashlight illuminates a familiar fork in the tunnel: left leads to the underground bathroom, and right leads to the meat plant’s wastewater.  \n\nTo follow in John’s footsteps, she must craft a test that aligns with Grace's flaw: a corrupt ambition to rise and become mayor, while sacrificing the health of thousands. It is time to give the mayor a dose of her own poison. Amanda crawls into the tunnel on her right.  ",

Blond hair, blue eyes, short skirt, walking out of her apartment with wafts of wild vanilla and a few fun quips like all those black and white films his mother used to watch alone in the kitchen.

As real as it gets.  \n\nTastes like poison. \n\nWell… why don’t you stop punishing yourself.  \n\nDavid’s left side pulls, again.

Get away!  \n\nThe fan jabs David, again.

He breathes deeply and takes in the floral notes of his cologne like soft petals drifting on the night breeze. He’s glad his nose still works and that he’s not having a heart attack even though he feels as though someone kicked his heart out of his chest.",

I have never seen a night quite like this one before.  \n\nDavid sighs. Go away… please…\n\nRik ignores him. Kind of hard on the back but looking at the stars seems to balance things out. \n\nPlease…\n\nLook at those clouds. There’s a storm coming. Better enjoy it while we can.  \n\nDavid turns to Rik and looks at him through puffy slits, but doesn't say anything.  \n\nYou know coconuts kill more people than sharks. I looked it up because someone told me this story about a couple who had been together for years. The woman always wanted her husband to go into the water while on vacation but he was terrified. He didn’t want to be eaten by a shark… \n\n…They go to the same place for twenty years and he never goes in the water. Then for her sixtieth birthday he decides he's going in. She's happy, and he's pumped. But as he walks to the beach… a coconut falls on his head. Dies right there on the spot.  \n\nYou'd think that would have been what she remembered. She had been a customer for years and she never once talked about the coconut. Someone else told me about it. She told me about all the other things… but not that… And she used to make me jealous cause I think people who know who they love are the luckiest people in the world—mightier than the mightiest in a wasteland of broken hearts. \n\nDavid clears his throat. Is that story supposed to cheer me up?  \n\nI'm not trying to cheer you up. I’m telling you that I'm jealous of you, Dave. And I’m not talking about Jasmine or the others.  \n\nThere you go assuming things you don't really understand.   \n\nI understand you. I understand love. And I know enough to know it’s not something you squander even if in the end there’s a cosmic coconut waiting for all of us.  \n\nDavid closes his eyes.  \n\nRik laughs softly. Her story would have made a pretty good movie. Except for the coconut ending. That would probably have to change.  \n\nDavid sighs heavily, and through a growing thickness in his throat, he whispers for Rik to leave him alone. To just leave him alone.  ",

    "6BAA324C4363AB45EDC9CF8607260D6E": "David opens his swollen eyes to find Rik staring at him. \n\nI had this regular who stopped coming to the pub a few years back. Found out she was in jail. Imagine that, jail. Murder. Matter of the heart. She discovered her husband was in love with another woman, so she lured him to their country home, drugged him with sleeping pills, boarded up the doors and windows and set it on fire while he slept.  \n\nHe woke up and tried to smash his way through the boards. But she was waiting for him with a hammer. As he tried to climb through the busted and burning wood—  \n\nWhack! Whack! Whack! \n\nShe smashed his arms, hands, shoulder with the hammer until he could scarcely move. All that remained was a terrible mess of a man trying to squeeze through busted boards with thick black smoke pouring past him like molasses. She stands there watching him dripping, burning, breathing, screaming, begging… and doesn't move until the police arrive.  \n\nDavid turns away from Rik but doesn't say anything.  \n\nHer husband cheated on her before, and it didn’t bother her, but this time, well, this time he was in love. That would make a good movie, too. Only she wouldn't kill him in the end, and he'd probably realize he was just going through a mid-life crisis. I never met someone I'd kill or die for, and I sometimes wonder what that would feel like… if I could do something like that…\n\nDavid feels Rik’s eyes on him.  \n\nI think my longest relationship was one year. I was told my ego gets in the way and that I don't like compromise. And that's true. But what's also true is I haven't met anyone who made me want to compromise.  \n\nDavid takes in the sounds of pedestrians walking past them.  \n\nYou know one client once told me that wolves either move in packs or alone or in a couple. Did you know that couples form such a strong bond… that when one dies… the other dies seconds after… As though wolves can just shut off life’s switch whenever they want. One soul following the other into the next world if you believe in that kind of thing.  \n\nDavid turns to face Rik. Please… I don't want to talk.  \n\nOne more story, then I'll leave you. It’s a true story that happened a hundred years ago in a time when this kind of story wouldn’t have even be told. I don’t remember how they met but when Richard and Will first laid eyes on one another they fell in love, and they kept their love a secret because back then… you could be hung for… well… for not loving like the rest. \n\nDavid feels a sudden warmth rising up his neck.   \n\nThey had secret lives, but eventually they were caught. And while so many lied and trembled before the executioner, they refused to lie about what they had… what they had found in each other. With the noose around their necks they were given another chance to repent… but they didn’t… instead of fear… there was only love… and Will grabs Richard’s hand and kisses it as the executioner pulls the cart from beneath their feet.  \n\nDavid’s puffy eyes drip with tears as he sees the two lovers dangling from the gallows. He wants to say something but feels an invisible noose tightening around his neck, choking him, preventing him from unburdening his heart.   \n\nThat would make a great movie.  \n\nDavid’s lips tremble. He wants to say so much, but the words just won’t come out, and he feels like he’s sinking deep into a world of mud. Then his face tightens and his whole body quivers as he tries to suppress the pain. Losing the battle, he erupts with gasps and broken words as he desperately tries to breathe.  \n\nAnd Rik grabs his arm, supporting him, holding him, preventing him from sinking deeper and deeper into the wasteland where so many have been lost and forgotten.

I couldn't say one thing… it was a bunch of little things that just made me feel good when I was around him. Everyone else makes me feel like I gotta be something I’m not. But not him.  \n\nI never did believe the press release.  \n\nMy parents can't stand each other. They should have divorced years ago… but they keep up the show and have their secret lives… so I guess that's normal.   \n\nIt works for some people.  \n\nI miss him. I miss us. I remember meeting him like it was yesterday. Just being with him was enough to know, and I knew right away that he was special and that he would somehow be an important part of my life. We met at music camp. I was seven and didn't want to go. Ironically, my mother forced me and I guess in a way she's the reason we met. I couldn't play any instrument…  \n\n…But Tristan… Tristan was something else… I liked listening to him play the piano…  At first my mother was happy… I had a music friend… maybe I would end up a violinist… \n\n…I guess she figured things out faster than I did because next thing I know she forbids him from coming over. She gave some excuse about his family being of improper standing.  \n\nThen the talks began. The responsibility of being a King. She tells me about the image of our family and the strength of our name and how I had pretty big shoes to fill… sacrifices for the family and all that bullshit. But she never said exactly what she meant. She always danced around what she really wanted to say.  \n\nDavid laughs. Tristan ended up going to the same secondary school as me. Funny how life works out. He used to write me notes… quotes… poetry… proverbs… smart-aleck comments he knew would make me laugh.  \n\nWe got back together in secret and were together for years until he began asking me to be introduced to my parents. Couldn't do it. I broke up with him. He broke up with me. Crazy fuckin' cycle.  \n\nLast year… he wanted a real commitment… he was talking about a family and kids… I nearly brought myself to doing it… but I didn't… I broke it off… and broke his heart.  \n\nHe didn't take it so well. Got pissed, and actually came to my birthday party at the pub… he just shows up… and he gives me a kind of Great Gatsby toast… and he hesitates… and I know what he wants to do… I know what he wants to say… but in the end he doesn't…  \n\n…Instead he says what good ol' pal I've been to him… and he makes a smart-aleck joke about how I'm a ladies man who will definitely never settle down… and with tears in his eyes… he finishes his toast with… To the importance of being King. Smart ass! And everyone toasts to it… even the Ol’Man.  \n\nKing laughs, then stops suddenly. Tristan staggers out with his pint and leaves an old note on the table. Something he had given me in an English class while the teacher was massacring one of his favorite writers with ridiculous interpretations.  \n\nHe called me a few days ago… invited me to a party at the Gold Lantern Cafe. A going away party… tonight… He's leaving for New York. Some piano gig. He's leaving with some guy he just met. They hardly know each other a month, and he’s following him to New York. How ridiculous is that? \n\nRik says nothing as they stare at the fading stars for a moment. Silent tears slip out of two narrow slits for eyes. David clears his throat and wipes the tears away with his arm. \n\nYou ever feel like just stopping?  \n\nRik turns to David. I imagine you'd have to start before you could actually stop. Way I see it… you've always been this lion, taking down the bully, the asshole, the abuser. Ever since I’ve known you, I’ve admired you for that. You’re great at clobbering the shit outta of anything that gets in your way except maybe yourself. I figure you could try building things, growing things, nurturing things… things like you.  \n\nRik squeezes his arm. You're a lion, Dave, and as much as you're going to hate me saying this… you're a circus lion tethered and dressed up like a clown. You need to tear the rope and costume with your own claws and teeth if you ever truly want to know what it's like to be you.  \n\nYou want to stop something… stop jumping through hoops… stop being the clown and just be the god damn lion you were born to be. You're about to regret something for the rest of your life and you know it.  \n\nDavid stares into space.   \n\nRik squeezes his arm, again. Way I see it… you owe someone a toast.  \n\nYou're an idiot if you think I'm just gonna walk over there and crash his party.  \n\nYou're an idiot if you don't run. ",

He yells at a waitress from across the room, and to his horror, she tells him Tristan already left for the airport. Her words stun him like a slap in the face. He’s too late, and his whole world is spinning out of control. He takes a moment to gather himself, then he decides and rushes out into the street, screaming wildly for a taxi. A taxi pulls to the curb. The driver looks at David, hesitates, then starts the meter and steps on the gas.   \n\nNext thing David realizes he’s bolting down the highway rehearsing what he’s going to say to Tristan. He struggles with ideas and words and feels nothing he comes up with is good enough. The taxi pulls up to the sliding, glass doors of the airport, and David vaults out.  \n\nThe driver yells at him. He returns to pay him and then rushes through the automated doors into a bustling open area. He quickly regards a monitor displaying flight departures. Sees one flight leaving for New York. Rushes trough the terminal. But— \n\nSecurity stops him in his tracks! Can’t pass without a boarding pass. David stares at him, trying to catch his breath as he processes everything at once. He tries to explain his situation, but the brute won’t budge, not even an inch.   \n\nDavid turns back and rushes to the check-in counter. He buys a business class ticket on the plane to New York. Then he runs back and passes through security.  \n\nHe runs faster and faster and he’s nearly there. He’s going to do this. He’s really going to do this! Suddenly, he smashes into an older man carting luggage who looks like his father with his salt and pepper hair and chiseled jaw. He tumbles over the ground as fear hits him like a fist, knocking the breath out of him for a moment.  \n\nJust a moment.  \n\nIn the chaos, he notices Tristan’s note on the ground. He grabs it. Holds it. Remembers. The man yells at David to be careful, but that’s the last thing David wants to do right now as he puts the note back into his pocket and clambers over a pile of luggage and charges away.  \n\nWithin moments, he sees the gate. Sees Tristan—\n\nLaughing with his partner.  \n\nHappy.  \n\nHe freezes in his tracks. Guilt smashes down on him like a brick wall, pushing and squeezing his insides into something awful. At once everything begins to spin as he realizes—\n\nHe’s going to be sick!  \n\nDavid turns on his heels, rushes to the bathroom with a hand over his mouth, and blasts through a stall to purge his stomach. Then he hobbles out and washes gunk off his face and feels like the most selfish person in the world. His busted and swollen face sags with the sudden realization that if he loves Tristan… if he truly loves Tristan… he will let him go.  \n\nRik got into his head, and he’s drunk. That’s all this is about. All he needs to do right now is be happy for Tristan. To be happy for him and go home and sleep this crazy night off.  ",

He made his bed, and now he has to fuckin' lie in it.   \n\nDavid approaches the security gate, and his heart clenches like a vice. It’s impossible to move. Something bigger than his doubt, his guilt and his fear won't allow him to take another step.  \n\nHis hand plunges into his pocket, and he turns the note over and over. Then, in a blazing flash, details of their struggle come back to him.\n\nHow could he let him go? The one whose voice was the only peace he had ever known, whose laugh was the only joy he had ever experienced, whose every breath filled him with life and whose every word challenged him to be a better man. \n\nHow could he leave without even trying? Without showing him that he was—in the end—willing to do whatever it took for what they had.  \n\nDavid realizes that if he doesn’t seize this moment he’ll never know, and the regret alone would destroy him. Tristan doesn’t just make him whole, he makes him real, and no one has ever had that effect on him. Suddenly— \n\nHe comes alive.  \n\nAnd turns. \n\nAnd fuckin' runs!  \n\nI don’t know what I’ll say… but I’ll say something… anything… I’ll say whatever comes to mind… maybe… maybe those three words from his favorite movie…   \n\nEnergy charges through David like a bolt of lightning, making him faster, stronger, and somewhat confident even though he has no idea what he’s going to say or do. He just runs, and his run becomes a stumbling sprint as he sees Tristan with his partner—\n\nAbout to board! \n\nHis mouth opens in a silent scream as he stumbles and falls on his face.  \n\nDavid… Is that you? \n\nTristan grabs David’s hand and helps him to his feet.  \n\nDavid straightens himself, and tries to look presentable despite the busted face and the mingled odor of ale, gunk and cologne. He smells like someone puked on a bed of flowers, and he knows it. \n\nBut he forgets how he looks and smells as he tries to stop his hands from shaking. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and calms himself. Then he reaches out and holds Tristan’s hands firmly. Words thicken like cement in his throat and nothing clever or poetic comes to mind. He tries to remember the line from the movie without success.  \n\nTristan’s partner steps forward, but Tristan gestures for him to be patient as he pulls David aside.  \n\nWhat’s wrong, David? What the hell happened to you?  \n\nDavid wants to tell Tristan he means the world to him. He wants to say, I love you. But instead, he says—\n\nNo more bullshit.  \n\nTristan mimes the words slowly, trying to understand.  \n\nDavid says them in a whisper, again and again, as he desperately waits for Tristan to say something, anything. Tristan says nothing, but his eyes mist, and he suddenly looks happy and sad and very confused at the same time.  ",

The last thing he expected was a fairy tale ending, and, of course, he understands Tristan needs time to think things through. How much time? Hopefully, not much. Just enough for him to step off the plane and call him to say…  \n\n…As you wish…  \n\nShit!  \n\nNow he remembers!  \n\nAt exactly the wrong moment.  \n\nDavid smirks. Doesn’t matter. He’s never felt so good, so free, so euphoric in his life. He lets the feeling flow past him like a gentle breeze and gets the sense that he’s been born again, or born for the first time, and that before this night he had merely existed as a cardboard cut-out with little self-awareness except for the fear that had come to rule his life.   \n\nHis hope is that when Tristan’s plane lands he will receive a phone call asking him to be on the next plane out. If, that is, he ever finds his wallet. No matter. If he can walk home from the airport, he can swim across the pond. He laughs to himself and figures his wallet will turn up somewhere. It always does. \n\nBut what if he calls to say it’s over.  \n\nThe thought catches him by surprise.  \n\nThat’s probably what will happen. Truth is, love doesn't triumph and our fears get the best of us, always. That’s why fairy tales are written. To escape the endless disappointments and heartaches of real life. Regardless of what you think, your love isn’t strong enough, and when he calls it’s only to tell you it’s over. For good. Because he won't let you break his heart, again.   \n\nDavid drowns the thoughts by singing louder and louder. Then he stops suddenly when he sees a park he half recognizes. It resembles a park where he and Tristan used to sit on a bench and people-watch all day.  \n\nHe enters the gates and for a moment he hears Tristan’s voice singing with him. He stops. Looks around, but doesn’t see anything through thick, slanting sheets of rain.  \n\nDavid continues through slumbering bushes and sagging flowers under a thick canopy dripping and pit-pattering with rain. He walks ahead until he hears a soft whisper. \n\nNo more bullshit.  \n\nHe turns to face—\n\nTristan.  \n\nHe rubs his puffy eyes and stares with disbelief.  \n\nTristan laughs. Only you could massacre a line like that. \n\nIt can’t be… it’s… impossible…  \n\nDavid narrows his gaze on Tristan’s silhouette. He must have somehow disembarked the plane. Or maybe he never boarded in the first place. He doesn’t really understand what’s happening, but he knows better than to overthink his luck.  \n\nDavid runs to embrace Tristan but just as soon as he touches him, he withers away like a dead flower. With a gasp, David drops to his knees, hopelessly trying to catch the falling petals that melt in his hands and drip through his fingers into a gathering fog.  \n\nHe barely has time to register what’s happening when he hears footsteps squelching in the mud and water all around him. He looks up slowly to see every single bully, abuser and shithead he ever took down advancing on him. His gut reaction is to pinch himself, yet nothing happens when he does. \n\nWith a deep sigh of resignation, David rises to his feet, lifts his chin and throws himself into the fray. He tackles and swings and kicks until he’s the last man standing with slithering tendrils of black fog pulling him down into a world of darkness untouched by the light of love.  ",

It is risky to stop at the village, but she needs supplies. \n\nCharlotte places Victor in the scarf wrapped around her torso. He is too weak to move. Too weak to speak. What the black cloaks did to him in the temple… changed him. To build his strength back, she needs to get some food and medicine.\n\nWalking down the village's narrow streets, she reaches the market. Her mother taught her how to get what she needed from a vendor's stall. Distract them and only take what you can carry. Leave before you're noticed. Better to be safe than… captured.\n\nShe spots a vendor selling herbs and ointments. Medicine is a priority. Charlotte pulls her hood over her face and approaches the stall slowly. Then she waits for an opportunity. When the vendor turns to address another customer, she extends her arm and snatches a few vials. \n\nThen she spots a pile of fruit at the back of the stall. Risky… but the sweet smell of ripe apples is enchanting. She glances at the vendor, who is arguing over prices. She crouches and slowly sneaks past him. \n\nWhen she reaches for the basket of fruit, she sees what lies under it: cured cheese. She grabs a large piece and shoves it in her bag with a few apples. Then she crouches under the stall and exits the opposite way she came in, leaving the vendor behind. \n\nWalking hurriedly, she heads down the street, where beggars are kindling rubbish. Despite the stank, the warmth of the flames feels good. \n\nSuddenly, a heavy hand falls on her shoulder. A towering man with a bow in his hand is staring down at her. \n\nHe smiles menacingly.

That one day they would be free. Is this the best she could do? A brutal plunge to their death?\n\nNo, she promised him. She would save him. \n\nLike she saved maman?\n\nCharlotte closes her prickling eyes. \n\nHer last finger is slipping. \n",

He would tap her shoulder when he needed something. She would hold his hand when she needed his attention. But he is too weak to move. Did he change position when the boulder slipped from under her? Unless… he is afraid, like her. Maybe he is begging her to save him. \n\nCharlotte inhales deeply, ignoring her burning arms. She looks up and sees another large boulder to her right, a bit higher. If she lunges, she could reach it. But one false move and she'd land in the river, her head smashed on rocks. \n\nHer heart is beating wildly, but she is no longer paralyzed. Victor needs her. And she would do anything to save him.  \n\nDigging her nails into the rock wall, Charlotte pulls with all her might and jumps. As she lunges into the air, her heart drops. Then her right foot lands on the higher boulder, which instantly shifts from under her. Terrified, she realizes that she is falling—slowly. Frantically grasping at the wall, she sways her arms, ignoring the sharp rocks tearing and burning her flesh. She closes her eyes as she slides down… but her right arm finds a grip, bringing her fall to a stop.  \n\nAs she holds on, her right foot lands on something solid, and she carefully shifts her weight on it. Her ears are ringing wildly, and her whole body is pressed against the jagged edge of the cliff.\n\nShe looks over her shoulder at Victor. He is cocooned in her scarf, safely. \n\nGritting her teeth, Charlotte looks up. The edge of the plateau is about a Toise high. She can do this. \n\nCharlotte finds a grip for her left arm. Then she pulls. One foot up. Then another. \n\nOn and on for what seems like an eternity. \n\nAll the way up, until she heaves herself over the edge of the plateau, safe.",

Because it means that she betrayed Victor. For a moment, she abandoned him. How could she be so cowardly and… selfish? \n\nCharlotte presses her hand over his cheek. Ice-cold. Isn't he already gone? No. She couldn't accept that. Losing him would be like laying down in a grave and waiting for soil to smother her. He is her. And she is him. They are one.\n\nShe caresses his pale cheek.

No. Charlotte could see some color on his cheeks. He will get better. \n\nGetting back on her feet, she examines her surroundings. A forest of evergreen trees stands ahead. And behind her… she gasps at the view. Tall pines spread west to the shoreline, where dark waves roll against a long bobbling wharf. A harbor of ships heading west. \n\nTo admire the ocean view, Charlotte sits on a bed of soft branches. The sun is setting, spilling blood into the sky. She loosens her scarf, unveiling Victor's face so he can see the boats. She reaches for his hand and grabs it. Ice-cold and limp. \n\nCharlotte stifles a sob. Everything is fine. Victor is just weakened by their journey. He is still here, with her. Tonight, they will rest, and he will get better. \n\nBelow, large ships are sailing toward the misty horizon, heading further west. They remind her of her mother's dream. When the black cloaks were doing their worse to her, she held onto her mother's words. Charlotte never honestly believed in her mother's dream of sailing west. It was just a beautiful escape. But now it is time to believe. A new dream for a new life.  \n\nCharlotte takes off her hat and wraps it around Victor's hands. Do you know what lies beyond the horizon? Maman told me once. She dreamt of that place, just before she fell sick. She said that there is another world across the ocean. A place with clean rivers and sweet syrup dripping from the trees. A whole other world for us to be free. Do you see that big ship below?\n\nNo answer. Maybe Victor is afraid of dreaming aloud. Some dreams are too delicate to be spoken. But not hers. \n\nCharlotte brushes off a drop of rain from Victor's pale brow. Everything will be alright, Victor. Just imagine the voyage with me. One day we will sail far away from here. We would sleep in a bed made of ropes, suspended in the air. Each rolling wave would swing our bed from side to side, lulling us to sleep. After a few weeks, we'd reach land. Then, we would find a little house by a creek. In the morning, we would work in a field of golden crops. Each day we'd drink the sun and eat the moon. And no storm would hit us. No men would burn us. No monsters would hurt us. We would live together, free. Our lives would be so normal, you would miss our adventures. Maybe one day, you'll even miss this view… I promise you. One day we will be free. We'll find a place where we belong. All three of us. \n\nHer voice breaks. No, they could never be all three again. Their mother is gone. Charlotte looks down at Victor. He is so weak that she could barely see his chest rise. \n\nNo, he is just sick. He needs to rest. She cannot pay her doubts any attention. If she does, she would be the next one to die. And then all three of them would be lost.\n\nCharlotte closes her eyes. She can almost feel the lush leaves brushing against her legs as she runs through an open field.

Images flash through her mind: soft feathers, sharp claws, and a delicate neck in her hands. Blood dripping from her brow as black cloaks beat her, until she wrapped her hands around the sparrow's neck and twisted. They forced her to do monstrous things. But she is no monster.\n\nYet she was treated as one. And why? Because Victor is part of her, and she is part of him. They are one, united by blood and bone. They cry double the tears when hurt.

The further she travels, the higher the risks of running into one. \n\nWhile scanning the darkness, she spots a crimson trail on the glittering snow. Further ahead, a large wolf is lying in the snow, its gray fur marred with blood. An arrow is planted in its neck. Hunters must have left it to die. \n\nThe wolf growls as its dark eyes land on her, but seems too weak to move. Then she hears a high-pitch cry. A little white cub hides under the wolf's leg. A dying wolf and its wailing baby, striving to survive.\n\nCharlotte knows what she must do. And she hates herself for it. \n\nShe leans over and grabs the tiny pup into her hands.

Howling, the wolf struggles to get back on its feet, but its legs buckle under its weight and crash into the snow.\n\nCharlotte ignores the dying wolf's whimpers and digs a hole in the snow, too deep for the pup to climb out of. When Charlotte's own mother screamed in agony, she wished someone would have ended her suffering. \n\nCharlotte approaches the pup's mother with trembling hands. The wolf growls as she grabs the arrow. In one swift motion, she pulls it out. The wolf howls in anguish and collapses. The cub cries in response, frantically digging itself out of the snow. Charlotte waves her branch at the pup and screams. Run! RUN!\n\nThe pup growls weakly… then darts off into the night. \n\nCharlotte's vision blurs as tears mingle with the blood splattered across her face. Is she any better than these hunters?

He had only disappeared a week and yet there were hundreds of entries. Perhaps, thousands. It made little to no sense. Neither did Junius. He had misjudged the money-man. He was a lot more compassionate than he had anticipated, and he seemed to express genuine sympathy for Tomas.  \n\nDespite being obsessed with profit, he is really quite human.  \n\nIt dawns on Talbot that Junius might in fact be two people and that The Company does a strange thing to him, acting almost like a catalyst.

What sets us apart from animals is our intellect, our ability to stand above our emotions for the greater good. And yet… \n\n…Talbot cannot help but entertain the thought that what sets humans apart from machines is our emotions. No. Not emotions. Our empathy. Our ability to feel what others feel just by imagining what they might be going through… what they might be suffering. That is an ability above and beyond the simple mechanisms of the intellect.  \n\nWhat an incredible power it is to be able to put ourselves in another person’s shoes. It’s why theatre and poetry and stories can even exist. Without empathy the human experience would have to be redefined as something else… something smaller… something closer to that of an insect. \n\nAnd yet…  \n\n…It’s the empathy variable that seems to be the great obstacle to achieving true objectivity.

Talbot considers the implications of those words over and over again as he prepares his leather satchel with his notebook, tools and vials. He then closes the satchel and wonders who in fact The Company answers to if not the King. Junius had once told him The Company was like a person and was given the same respect as a person. And yet, The Company didn’t seem like a person. It seemed like something else. Something different. Something, perhaps, like a beast… a beast pretending to be a person. A dark thing unleashed into the world to destroy and plunder and return to its masters with a mouthful of death and a fistful of gold. A part of Talbot hated being a part of this dark thing for the longest time. But over the years he had found a way to rise above his guilt and admire the sheer power and brilliance of what it could do in the world and what it could achieve for its masters without reproach. \n\nWhen the beast became a problem, the masters could simply end its life abruptly, burying the beast and all the pain, death and horror it had caused in a forgotten grave. But not the gold. Not the plunder. They, the masters, could keep it all. Keep the gold and the plunder and eventually use it to inject life into a new beast or, perhaps, beasts. The Company may not have been a person, but it was certainly a form of life. And gold was its life-force. Its blood. \n\nTalbot suddenly feels inspired. Gold is energy. No. Not gold. Currency. Currency is energy. No. Not energy. A variable to direct and control people. To manipulate the fold. Yes. There is something worth exploring in the thought. Something worth pursuing. Something that could help The Company and its masters. He asks himself if there is a way to understand people in reduced terms—in terms of energy and equations. \n\nTalbot quickly pulls out his notebook and jots down a concept: Fold Energy. He scribbles down an equation, crosses it out, then rewrites another version. He examines the equation, then releases a sigh and crosses it out again. He wonders for a long moment if people could actually be reduced to a chemical equation that could somehow determine output and potential. \n\nIt was a strange idea. Perhaps even an awful idea. And yet this idea had legs—legs like a beast. It was certainly plausible to treat people as a kind of energy that could be contained and controlled except for one variable—the human variable. \n\nEmpathy. \n\nThe strength of currency as a variable to control, manipulate and predict energy flow would be directly proportional to the value people placed on currency in their lives. But… there had to be ways to remove or reduce the human variable. To somehow turn currency into a collective god, or, in the very least, a demi-god. Something the fold feared, prayed to, and constantly meditated on. One single god to control them all. One single variable to stimulate, shock, and direct Fold Energy. \n\nTalbot stares at his notebook and laughs to himself. The idea is ludicrous! There are no legs! There’s no present or future world where he or anyone else could experiment on eliminating the human variable. Such a thing not even The Company could get away with. But if it could… \n\n…If it could… \n\n...It would be far more powerful and effective at controlling the fold than any King or Empire. \n\nTalbot scratches out his equations, realizing they are nothing more than highly imaginative scribbles masquerading as science. Even if The Company were granted the ability to experiment on the fold without limits he could not imagine how this intangible human variable could be reduced let alone removed from the equation. All the cultures and communities and diverging beliefs and values would never allow such a god or demi-god to exist. \n\nShaking his head at the absurdity of his theory, Talbot closes his notebook, places it in his satchel and prepares for the journey to come.

The thought of conscious mist or fog almost seems absurd. He stares at the fog for a long moment then hears Ena’s voice calling out his name from within the Bleed. He sighs, ignores the voice, and for a moment regrets the swig of laudanum he took to calm his heart and focus his thoughts. Then, as the men continue to gasp and whisper concerns about the fog, Talbot closes his eyes and takes one small step into the unknown. ",

Large crows he barely recognize circle and caw in the dark sky. Two company soldiers step up beside him with their eyes wide with disbelief. \n\nTalbot turns to Calder and Oswald. He scrutinizes the passage of fog behind them, waiting for Dallin to push through. Where’s your friend? \n\nCalder and Oswald realize they lost Dallin and proceed to wave the fog and call out his name. Then Calder moves into the fog, but Talbot grabs his shoulder, stopping him. We are not where we think we are? \n\nCalder pulls away from Talbot. I’m not sure what that’s supposed to mean? \n\nWe can’t just leave him? \n\nTalbot approaches the fog separating them from the camp. My thoughts are that he turned and returned to camp. \n\nCalder and Oswald exchange a look with Talbot. Then Calder steps forward and leads them into the blue and purple gloom. \n\nThey soon approach a wall of vines with a luminous blue nectar-like substance flowing through veins blocking their path. Talbot reaches up and gently pulls a petal from small a flower and places it in a vial. \n\nCalder withdraws a machete with a high-pitch ring and the vines seem to suddenly tremble. \n\nTalbot senses something amiss and grabs Calder’s arm mid-swing. \n\nNot the best idea. \n\nNonsense. \n\nCalder yanks his arm free and savagely cuts a path through the vines as a purple substance splatters all over him.  \n\nInstantly the butchered vines shrivel up and disintegrate like embers into small puffs of fog. Talbot watches with his mouth hanging as the other vines seem to retract from Calder as though conscious of his lethal intentions. They seem to be retreating from a threat. \n\nCalder nudges Talbot and gestures for him to snap out of his trance. But as he takes a step forward the volcanic rock below his feet suddenly crack open, black fog spews out, and a thick vine slithers out and touches Calder’s boot. \n\nBefore Talbot can stop him, Calder stamps the vine like a snake. He laughs and shakes his head as the vine snaps alive, wraps around his ankle and rips his leg off with impossible power. A fountain of hot arterial blood sprays the cold darkness as Calder screams in agony.  \n\nTalbot swallows hard as Oswald panics to help the tracker. He moves past the screaming man and stares at the retreating vines with mingled curiosity and disbelief. \n\nIt might be that this other realm is very much conscious. A living realm analyzing and testing them. To what purpose, he isn’t sure. But— \n\nScreams suddenly interrupt Talbot’s thoughts. He turns on Calder and suppresses an impulse to yell at him. He’s likely in excruciating pain and didn’t mean the interruption. He quickly puts on an expression of concern and kneels by his trembling body, wondering how long a person can live without a leg. \n\nOswald cries that they should take him back to camp. But Talbot’s unwilling to compromise his one opportunity to observe and study what no chemist has ever observed or studied before. Yet he doesn’t want to waste time arguing with Oswald. He simply wouldn’t understand. He tells Oswald he needs to dress Calder’s wounds before they can carry him back to camp. \n\nOswald nods agreement as Talbot withdraws a bottle of laudanum, his concoction, a mixture more powerful than anything any company has ever produced. He places the bottle to Calder’s lips, tells him the serum will ease the pain, and he proceeds to pour the contents down his trembling mouth. \n\nWithin moments, Calder stops shaking and his eyes roll back as he issues his last breath. Talbot allows a small grin and he suddenly feels the barrel of a pistol at the base of his head. \n\nWhat did you do to my friend? \n\nTalbot closes his eyes and waits for death. ",

As his finger curls around the trigger, a massive cloud of fog rushes up to him and grabs him like a fist and pulls him—kicking and screaming—into the darkness. Talbot stands on shaking legs staring at the scene incredulously. It was as though this realm was protecting him. It was as though it was keeping him alive for some unknown reason. He felt a sudden pang of guilt for Calder and Oswald, then it was gone, and he began to follow the spiraling path of jagged rock illuminated by luminous vines and flowers. He followed it for a long while when he heard her voice again. It couldn’t be. Ena. He stopped, turned round and round, searching desperately. This time he was sure it wasn’t the laudanum. It was this place. It wasn’t protecting him. It was… messing with him… playing with him like a cat does a mouse.

He examines the round shape, smooth texture and places it in a vial. Then he grabs another vial and begins to catch droplets of this otherworldly fluid, wondering if like the poppy it could open doorways within the mind. A strangled gasp suddenly breaks the almost palpable silence. He searches the small twisted trees and shrubs and soon finds Oswald with his back against a boulder, sucking in quick shallow breaths, covering a wound in his stomach with his hand. He looks up at Talbot.  \n\nQuick, please… It’s coming back for me.  \n\nTalbot is torn between helping him and moving on.  \n\nWhat is? What’s coming for you? What did this to you? \n\nTalbot takes a shuddering breath and kneels beside Oswald, opening his satchel and searching for thread to stitch him up.   \n\nIt’s hunting us… the man-beast. Nothing hurts it… Nothing… I shot it, cut it, stabbed it and it continued after me...  \n\nSave your strength.  \n\nI found the others. They’re alive… this thing… it's making something with them.  \n\nTalbot retrieves the thread and begins to stich up the gash. He turns to the satchel and his eyes take in the luminous blue fluid he collected from the vines and flowers. He’s not sure what it does, and he knows it will be a while before he does.   \n\nTalbot stares at Oswald. He can’t do it. He shouldn’t do it. And yet, this is an emergency. He must do what he can to help him even if it means taking a chance on an untested serum.  \n\nHe almost has no choice.  \n\nHe hesitates, then grabs the vial and stares at it. He knows he’s lying to himself. He knows there are other ways to help him. But he also knows The Company hasn’t officially accepted his proposal for human experimentation. Human experimentation could take a long time, a real long time, and he doesn’t have a long time. It might be years before he gets another chance like this. He could administer a drop… just a drop… and see what medicinal properties the nectar-like secretion may or may not have.  \n\nThe secretion is a gift from another world. Last thing he wants is to spend years staring at the vial collecting dust on a wooden shelf in his laboratory while The Company debates the merits of his proposal. In fact, they’ll be grateful he took the initiative.  \n\nSlowly, he lowers the vial to the wound. He tilts the lip slightly and lets a tiny drop slip out into the sticky wound. He waits for his blood to absorb the secretion and watches ever closely.  \n\nAt first nothing seems to happen. Then all at once Oswald’s face twists in horror as his body warps. A fiery blue light burns through him as blue and purple sacks begin to cover his body.  \n\nTalbot stares, amazed. He’s never seen anything like it. It’s incredible. One drop shocked his entire system within a few minutes. The mutation and energy release alone seemed impossible. And yet… there it was… right in front of him.  \n\nOswald screams as one boil after another erupts with purple puss.  \n\nAmazement turns to fear as Talbot stares at the ghastly sight and realizes what he’s done to the cook. His mind searches desperately for ways to help the poor man but there’s nothing he can do. Over the screams he hears Ena’s disembodied voice echoing behind him.  \n\nTalbot, dear, what have you done? What have you done! \n\nTalbot scrambles back on his heels, then turns and charges through the madness of this impossible world with a maelstrom of conflicting emotions rushing through him.  \n\nWhat have I done? What have I done! \n\nTalbot shambles through thick vines and clambers over rocks and corpses blooming with luminous flowers. He tumbles to the ground and tells himself it was for the greater good.  That the cook was probably going to die anyway. That he’s doing something important. That he’s searching for chemicals and compounds potent enough to transport people to other worlds at the speed of thought.  \n\nThe speed of thought is the only way to travel between worlds, and the doors to these unseen and unknown worlds are within… and any effort in trying to find those keys far outweigh the life of a cook.  \n\nDesperately, he clambers to his feet and finds himself surrounded by a living mass of black fog. He stares at it intently and his panicking mind calms with amazement as he finds himself staring at tiny cells that undulate together like some sort of vaporous membrane. Then— \n\nThe fog slowly dissipates to reveal a tree covered in thick black leaves.  \n\nTalbot stares at the tree and begins to notice the trunk writhing and realizes it made of people. He realizes in amazement that he has found the missing employees. He begins a slow march toward this tree of death with his eyes wide and his jaw hanging. It’s beautiful and horrific at the same time. It’s… \n\nSublime.  \n\nIt’s the only word that comes to mind.   \n\nAs Talbot approaches the gnarled tree, the black leaves suddenly take flight, revealing themselves to be massive crows. He gazes skyward and watches the crows disappear into the darkness. Then he hears the crunch of stone and quickly lowers his gaze to find himself face to face with the man-beast.  \n\nThe creature stares at Talbot with a gaping mouth and glowing blue eyes as though recognizing him. It hesitates and seems conflicted as it peers into his disbelieving eyes. Suddenly— \n\nThe creature shrieks something horrible and vines burst out of its hands and wrap around his chest squeezing the breath out of him until he slowly drifts into nothingness.  \n\nWith a gasp, Talbot opens his eyes alone in the desert under a blistering sun with no sense of the passage of time. He remembers pulling himself off the tree. He remembers someone crying out to him for help. He remembers taking samples as everything evaporated before his eyes. Then he remembers walking and collapsing under a scorching white sun, wondering if he was going to suddenly wake up in another world or, perhaps, in an opium den.  \n\nTalbot struggles to sit up as a mirage of men on camels gallop toward him. He looks down to his clenched fist, opening it slowly to reveal a blue and purple flower.  ",

They pulled him off a bit too fast. And so he thought he’d investigate on his own. Not the best idea he'd ever had. But something in him had to know. Had to understand why he was ordered to stay away from these cryptic messages that contained the name of people who would sometimes disappear. To him this seemed somehow related to human trafficking. But Dean… \n\n…Dean didn’t fit the pattern. He wasn’t like the others who had disappeared. He was loud and outspoken and blaming the government for everything that had happened to his students. \n\nHe needed to find the high school teacher before these henchmen did. ",

The derelict house at the end of the road had a roof that sagged and a warped, wide-covered deck with birdfeeders that hadn’t been filled in years. The vast cornfields surrounding the farm house were wild and rumpled. A chime dangling from a nearby gnarled tree rang softly in the warm, humid wind as Max Holt, sitting on a hill at a distance, used binoculars to examine the barns, the rusting tractors and an old collapsing outhouse. Just beyond the farm, he noticed a cemetery with gravestones, etched black against the dusk. He sighed, lowered the binoculars and wiped beads of sweat off his brow. \n\n“So why exactly am I in Texas?” He asked, adjusting a small device in his ear. “What’s so special about this abandoned farm?” \n\n“It’s not abandoned… We decoded a name two days ago and tracked him here.” Haddie’s voice emerged through the tiny black, communication device in his ear. \n\n“What do we know about the mark?” \n\n“Tom Smith. Born in Nevada. Worked as a creative manager in the 60s and 70s in South America for several multinational corporations. No citations. No tickets. No fines. Always paid his taxes on time. Perfect record.” \n\n“Sounds like a cover.” \n\n“Good observation. His real name is Luis Rand. Born in Oakland. Film degree from UCLA. Recruited by the government for a special department. Luis ended up in charge of manufacturing rebellion. Meaning, he produced fictional radio broadcasts in several countries reporting on the victories of rebels that never existed.” \n\n“Why go through all that trouble?” \n\n“People don’t act if they’ve lost hope.” \n\n“What year are we talking about?” \n\n“1950s. Luis created fictional rebel groups to revolt against a government that was trying to do some good for its people. Each broadcast reported a growing rebellion marching on the capital to depose of the president. Usual fare… lies, terror, propaganda… fabrications designed to make the rebels seem unbeatable so no one would dare oppose them. The agency created a boogeyman that never existed, and they used that boogeyman to overthrow an elected president trying to do some good for his country.” \n\n“Right,” Max said. “And heard they’re working on a sequel to the original ‘War of the Worlds.’ Looking forward to that, myself. Heard it’s an epic Five Eyes co-production with no expenses spared.” He chuckled as he scanned the vast empty fields behind the farm. “Should I be looking out for mutilated cows or scorched geometric shapes in cornfields?” \n\n“Not funny, Max. These operations corrupted, destabilized and destroyed entire countries, and Luis has information the Vale wants. You need to get to him before they do.” \n\nSuddenly, Max heard a rumbling in the distance. His binoculars swiveled to a black SUV thundering down the dirt road, throwing great clouds of dust in the air. “Shit, we might be too late. I’ve got an SUV approaching fast.” He hooked his binoculars to his belt and withdrew his pistol. “I’m heading in.” \n\n“Watch yourself.” \n\n“Always.” \n\n \n\nMAX RUSHED DOWN THE HILL as the SUV came to a stop and three shadowy figures vaulted out. Two agents kicked the front door and charged into the house while the other stood guard outside. As Max approached the entrance he lowered to a stealthy crab-walk. From inside he suddenly heard someone cry out in pain. They had Luis and were preparing to torture him. He had to move fast. \n\nWith a great sense of urgency, Max inched closer to the guard, concealing himself in the shadows. Then, all at once, he sprung up behind him, took him in a chokehold and squeezed until his torso shook and his legs sagged. \n\nCarefully, Max lowered the unconscious agent to the ground as Luis released another scream. They had begun to interrogate him. He didn’t have much time. \n\nMax followed the edge of the house to an open window and climbed inside the cluttered home and nearly slipped on a counter covered in grime and dead flies. Stacks of dirty dishes covered the kitchen table. Piles of magazines and books rose from the floor to the ceiling. On the walls were black and white surveillance photos of artists painting murals and protesting various dictators that had been selected and sponsored by the agency. \n\nMax picked his way into the hallway, moving slowly toward the sound of hard knuckles hitting swollen flesh accompanied by the occasional groan. He froze suddenly when everything stopped and one of the agents spoke. “Where are the letters? Where are The Crows? Who else knows about them?” \n\nLuis didn’t answer. \n\nThe punches and groans continued, and so did Max. He inched slowly toward the living room, picking his way around the stacks of boxes and crates, stopping with each step to listen. \n\n“Where are the letters?” \n\nLuis coughed and struggled with every word. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m just an old man who hoards a lot of useless junk from around the world.” \n\nMax reached the living room and peeked through the open doorway. \n\nOne agent prepared a small bottle of orange serum and held it up to Luis. “I’ll ask my questions, again. Disappoint me and you get a drop of Grime. Disappoint me, again, and we move to a spoonful. Another time, and it’s the bottle. If we’re mistaken, and you’re just an old man who likes to hoard junk from around the world, then you have no idea what Grime will do to you.” \n\nThe agent tilted the bottle and let a drop form at the rim of the bottle and asked, “Where are the letters? Where are The Crows? Who else knows about them?” \n\nLuis shook his head. “You’re dealing with forces you couldn’t possibly understand.” \n\nThe agent smiled and let a drop of Grime fall into Luis’ busted mouth. Luis struggled to keep his mouth closed, but the drop dissolved into his cuts and swollen lips. \n\n“I’m told a drop of Grime unlocks a doorway to hell,” the agent said. “I can’t imagine what a bottle would do. Let’s try, again, and let’s not presume to know what I would and wouldn’t understand.” \n\nLuis scoffed. “You remind me of myself when I was first at the agency. Do you even know who you’re working for? Who you’re really working for? Not the government. Not even the corporations. That’s what I thought at first when I realized we weren’t working for the government… I thought we were working for the corporations… But they’re just tools like the agency for a very dark end.” \n\n“Where are the letters!” \n\nThe agent filled a spoon with serum and thrust it into his mouth, breaking his four front teeth. \n\nLuis gagged and coughed and spat blood and saliva. After a long moment he said, “You know the serum you hold is made from a very peculiar flower that comes from another place. And I don’t mean another country.” \n\n“Where are The Crows!” \n\n“Your true masters are into some crazy shit. They are. They don’t just sacrifice people to their ancient god. No. That would be too easy. They go a step beyond. They sacrifice villages, towns and countries, turning them into places of fear. It’s all about the fear… hate… anger…” \n\nLuis nodded. \n\n“What we did in the 50s and 70s was just the beginning. They want to sacrifice the world. They do. They think by turning this world into a living hell they’ll bring forth transcendence.” \n\n The agent sighed. “You are a stubborn old mule, aren’t you.” He grabbed his hair, tilted his head back and smashed the bottle into his mouth just as Max sprung from the shadows in one fluid motion, firing two rounds into each surprised face. Then he rushed to Luis and pulled the bottle out of his gaping mouth. \n\nLuis smiled at Max. “I ain’t getting out of this one. I can already hear the voices… the horror…” \n\n“Luis, stay with me.” \n\nLuis stared at Max for a long moment. Then he said, “You’re the ones, they’re after—the wrench in their finely oiled killing machine.” \n\nMax nodded as the Comms in his ear sounded. “Ask him about what they wanted?” He inched closer to Luis. “What do you have that scares them so much?” \n\nLuis smiled. “Words.” \n\n“Words?” \n\n“Poetry. Art. Letters.” Luis began to sob, and Max was sure the serum was beginning to act on his faculties. Then he continued, “I thought I was a patriot, preventing threats to our way of life. Imagine my surprise when I found out the agency is just a tool for a bunch of rich assholes in dark robes. I hurt so many people… they’re coming for me… ” \n\n“What did they want?” \n\nLuis struggled against the poison coursing through his veins. \n\n“We targeted her because she was connected. She could see things in the other world. She could see their faces and she could paint them in a way no remote viewer ever could. When we tried to own her… her voice… her art… so she wouldn’t expose us… she still painted… whatever she wanted.” \n\nLuis fell silent, and his face tightened. \n\n“Her mother was the same, and we intercepted her letters to her daughter. We couldn’t let her know her mother was still alive. Both mother and daughter had something between them we couldn’t possibly understand. A variable we had somehow overlooked.” \n\nLuis groaned and trembled and struggled to calm himself before he continued. \n\n“We paid her father to keep a close eye on her and report anything unusual in her art. She could see crows from the other world… she told her father they were following her, protecting her, and he thought she was crazy.” \n\nLuis began to breathe heavily. \n\n“It was all there in her collection…The Crows… a blueprint of how they planned to sacrifice the entire world to their ancient god. I’ve seen the paintings, and I still don’t get it. I hate what we did to that poor girl and her brother. At least the mother… got away…” \n\nLuis trailed away. He collected his thoughts and took in a deep breath. \n\n“The girl nearly got away too. She ran, and she started a collective of artists, a rebellion we didn’t control, and they painted and wrote poetry against the corruption—against the darkness.” \n\nLuis shook his head, almost in disbelief. \n\n“They published a book of poetry along with an underground magazine. We had to find every single one of those books and periodicals and burn them.” \n\nLuis began to stammer. \n\n“Her mistake was going to her father… for all the things she had seen she did not see him.” \n\nLuis lost himself for a moment. Tears formed in his eyes and slowly slipped down his face as he continued. \n\n“She was just an experiment and she ended up turning against us. She was the key, the leader, the inspiration for them and for me…” \n\nHis eyes widened as though he saw something horrible behind Max. He closed his eyes and when he opened them again he continued with difficulty. \n\n“What we did to them… I will never forgive myself for.” \n\n“Do you have the letters?” \n\n“They’re coming for me! I can hear them!” \n\n“Do you have the paintings!” \n\nLuis started, then nodded as he struggled for every breath. \n\nMax realized he didn’t have much time. “Are they in the house?” he asked, leaning closer to Luis. But Luis didn’t answer. He tried to speak with difficultly, whispering: \n\n“15… 13…” \n\nHe repeated the numbers again, then suddenly shrieked and thrashed in the chair. Max tried to rip the tape off his arms as he jerked about, making the chair thump against the creaking floors. \n\nWhen Max finally freed him, Luis jackknifed to his feet, charged past him and dove straight through the window. Bleeding from multiple lacerations, he crawled toward the cemetery before his mouth froze in a hideous scream of terror. \n\n \n\nOUTSIDE IN THE GROWING DARKNESS, Max knelt beside Luis checking for a pulse but didn’t find any. Luis' eyes were wide and his hand extended out toward the cemetery. “Nothing you could have done for him,” Haddie’s voice sounded in his ears. Max stared at the dead man’s hands, then the cemetery where he saw gravestones in the moonlight. \n\n“15… 13… It could be a safety deposit box.” Haddie observed. \n\nMax nodded. “Yeah, it could be.” He narrowed his eyes on the cemetery. The trail of blood Luis left on the ground was like an arrow pointing to a gravestone. “Hold on, I got a hunch.” \n\nMax stood and proceeded toward the cemetery. \n\n“You need to be careful. There could be more agents on their way.” \n\n “Government agents I can handle. It’s the other shit I’m worried about.” \n\n \n\nMAX FOUND A BURIAL PLOT MARKED 1513 IN THE SMALL CEMETERY, and using a shovel he had found in a barn, he dug deep into the ground until he hit a coffin. He jumped down into the hole and brushed the dirt off the lid with his blistered hands. Then he heaved the rotten lid open to find a thick lining of black plastic. As he ripped the plastic apart, the scent of wet earth, paint and burnt wood hit him like slap in the face. But within moments he found himself staring at sketches, books, envelopes, statuettes and paintings from different times and origins. “Jackpot!” he said, and activated his cellphone camera to send a live stream to Haddie who was sitting safely in the back of a cramped bookstore in New York City. \n\n“Mora,” Haddie said as she observed the paintings. “We’ve sensed she was ‘marked’ like the others but could never prove it. She was clearly connected…” Her voice trailed away pensively as he held the cellphone above a painting of a medieval lord surrounded by stacks of bodies in a crumbling castle. “Looks like another artist… also seeing into the other realm…” \n\nMax scanned the paintings, then moved on to a copy of a book titled, ‘Poets Against the Darkness.’ From within the book he pulled out an envelope with ‘WSFM’ written on it. “What does WSFM stand for?” \n\n“Weird Science and Freakin' Magic department.” \n\nMax chuckled. “What?” \n\n“True story… you’re starting to lag—” \n\nMax looked up and to his horror he noticed a thick, unnatural fog creeping over the open grave. “Shit!” he said with dawning realization. “I think I’m in a Bleed. I think that’s why Luis hid the artifacts here.” \n\nBut Haddie didn’t respond. A high pitch whine sounded in his ear and he instantly pulled off the earpiece. As he thrust his comms into his pocket, he saw crows circling above and felt his entire body suddenly prickle with needles. His body was reacting to another vibration as he shifted in and out of another dimension. As he tried to gather himself, he heard a twig snap above. He looked up to see a tall woman made of darkness standing by the grave. \n\nMax quickly hid inside the coffin, pulling the wooden lid over. He stared through a crack in the wood at the dark apparition looming above him. It stared down at the coffin with cold black eyes and black blood like ink dripping down from its fingers. A crow flew down into the grave, landing on the coffin, pecking nervously at the lid, giving away his position. \n\nMax closed his eyes and waited to be dragged away to this other world. But the crow disappeared and the apparition drifted away from the grave. Max quietly slipped out of the coffin and climbed out of the grave, ascending into a world of fog. He could hear the crows circling above but couldn’t see them. As he ran, he heard the sound of his heart thumping against his chest, and then he heard footsteps. Behind him. Growing faster. Louder. \n\nMax glanced over his shoulder but saw only a mass of fog. He didn’t wait for whatever lurked in the darkness to snatch him. He charged through the cemetery, jumped over the fence and stumbled miserably to the ground. Then he closed his eyes and lost consciousness as a high-pitched whine filled his ear. \n\nWhen at last he opened his eyes, it was morning and beams of golden sunlight poured through the cracks of a door illuminating the darkness and warming his face. He had no recollection of what had transpired, only vague flashbacks of dragging himself over the ground while unnatural and incomprehensible things moved around him. \n\nHe remembered the crows, the woman with the black eyes, and the shrieks and screams that rent the night. He remembered seeing the outhouse and crawling through a layer of fog. He remembered opening the creaking, red door and hiding inside. Everything else was a blur. \n\nCovered in dirt and filth, he stepped out into the harsh, white sunlight. He grabbed his phone and called Haddie. A moment later her face appeared on the small screen. \n\n“Thought we lost you there.” \n\n“I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck… but I’m still here…” Max turned round and round, staring at the old farm. “I don’t remember much.” \n\n“You were out the whole night.” \n\n“Yeah… well… It felt like an eternity.” ",

All killed in a ritualistic manner. And as night descended, she set the victims of the Black Serpent Society ablaze. The flames rose violently and shot burning red embers into the black abyss above. As the fire waved and crackled, Saku watched the flames devour flesh and tried not to think of the suffering the Society had put the village through. One of their members was ‘Becoming’ and the Becoming ceremony was a rite of passage. The member would drink tea brewed from the purple petals of a flower they harvested from another world, and this tea either killed them or brought them a nightmare from this other world that they would have to recreate in this one. She had witnessed three of these nightmares before. Horrifying monuments made out of villagers who had been hunted down like game and tortured and restructured into a human offering. She didn’t know what horrors these snakes had seen in the other world, but whatever they had seen could not have been more horrific and brutal than what they created in this world. \n\nReflecting on the offerings Saku had seen in the past, she expected she would find a similar offering not too far from the village. And so, preparing for the worst, she grabbed a branch on the ground and lit a torch from the burning pyre. Carefully, she made her way into the surrounding woods. \n\nIt wasn’t long before Saku found a pile of clothing and a trail of gore and petals. She followed the trail to a mound of beautiful flowers growing from the hacked bodies of villagers. With a sigh, she examined the area, the flickering torchlight lighting the way. Within moments, she realized the area had been hacked and cleared so that it resembled a kind of maze. The villagers had been hunted and captured in this maze that was meant to resemble a snake’s nightmare. \n\nThat’s what she called members of the Society. \n\nSnakes. \n\nThere was nothing human about them. People had warmth and empathy, and these cultists lacked both and likely had cold blood running through their veins. And Saku knew the creator of this maze and offering might still be around, embedded in its offering to the Black Serpent, symbolically shedding its human skin. \n\nSaku turned back to the offering and held her breath as she searched the ghastly faces of the dead for signs of life. As she searched for the snake in this garden of death, she suddenly heard the crackle of undergrowth behind her. Instinctively, Saku ducked as a thick ax whirred over her head and cut through flowers and a bloated torso. Stepping back, she dropped the torch and turned to face a snake in a demon mask shrieking at her. The snake withdrew the ax attacked wildly. \n\nWith short, quick steps, Saku evaded savage blows. Then she withdrew her gleaming sword and in one fluid motion, she decapitated the snake and watched the headless torso stagger left and right as a fountain of warm blood sprayed the ground and trees. The torso collapsed and became one with the offering as the head rolled away and finally stopped at the base of a tree. \n\nSaku walked over to the head, picked it up, and removed the mask to reveal a young woman with wide, unblinking eyes. Feeling sad for this woman who had been charmed, groomed and corrupted by the Society, she carried the head to the offering where she placed it next to the torso. \n\nGently, Saku picked up the flickering torch from the ground and set the offering on fire. The burning stack of bodies reflected bright orange in her eyes as she remembered her clan and wondered if she would ever stop the Society from corrupting and destroying her beloved country. ",

We should turn back.”  \n\n“Nonsense,” Ian said, finding the hole in the fence. “It’s going to be just like old times.”  \n\nExcept that it wasn’t. Today would be better than old times. Today would be a special day—a day like none other.

He was going to do it. He was really going to do it.  \n\nLori stopped suddenly and pointed at two hawks circling in the distance. Ian stepped up to her, observing, and she snapped pictures.  \n\nAn omen, he thought. A beautiful, majestic couple working together in complete harmony. They circled together in the amber sky, one clockwise, the other counter-clockwise. Their graceful paths twined and intersected with wings fully spread as they searched for dinner. Then they stopped circling and swept down with wings half-bent, disappearing into the woods.  \n\nLori trained her camera at the trees waiting for the hawks to reemerge with dinner. But when no hawk burst from the trees after a few minutes, they continued up the trail, reminiscing about the first time they had met on the trail.

His father told the best horror stories, and those stories always gave him what no other story could: a greater appreciation for his life. The vivid words. The creepy sounds. The perfectly designed dramatic pauses that made him suddenly conscious of the pounding heartbeat in his ears. Wanting the story to continue and stop at the same time. Uncomfortable. Unsettled. Yet, captivated. And then—  \n\nThe climax!  \n\nAnd the rush of adrenaline that followed.  \n\nBut the adrenaline wasn’t what he enjoyed the most. No. It was something else. It was… he wasn’t sure what it was… He didn’t want to save the world, or win the Olympics, or travel to a foreign country to see something new and exotic. He just wanted the horror to end. He wanted his life back.  \n\nThe scarier the story the more he appreciated his life. And to know that his father’s stories were true doubled that feeling. Doubled the spell the story had on him. The truth of those stories made them far more potent than those dark fantasies that came from the imagination. His father’s stories were real and that made them scarier.  \n\nMuch scarier.  \n\nHis father wanted him to design stories just like he did. Follow his path. Hunt and murder human beings in the shadows.  \n\nAnd he did.  \n\nJust not in the way his father had intended.  \n\nAnd now Danny designs better stories. Much better stories. Better because of the setting. Because they could happen anywhere, unlike his father’s stories which took place in what experts called ‘abnormal circumstances’ where scary and gruesome stories were expected.  \n\nHis settings made the horror all the more unique.  \n\nAll the more unexpected.  \n\nAnd now, as Danny sits on his couch in his air-conditioned studio apartment, he feels the sudden need to design another story.

He took a class in anthropology once. And he remembers the heated debates with his teacher who tried to make him believe in this ridiculous theory of the homo sapiens—that humanity was intrinsically curious and intelligent species that evolved toward peace and prosperity with its many civilizations and achievements.  \n\nDanny argued the opposite. He argued humans were intrinsic killers—killers that evolved to enslave, acquire, destroy and eventually self-destruct. That the achievements and the civilizations were tools for blood. That the mask of civilization was a façade, a farce, an elaborate design to hide the true face of humanity—the bloody face of horror, as he often liked to call it.

That’s what his old man said almost every dawn when he’d drop a penny on his bed to check if it was made properly. Stern as steel. Hard as a rock. Crazy as a loon. But not wrong. Definitely, not wrong.   ",

He opens his heavy eyelids and cranes his sticky neck to see John through the living room window getting his horror fix from the late-hour news. Mass fear stimulating the adrenaline glands and slowly becoming relief and appreciation for abnormal, day-to-day, civilized living. Ten horror stories for every one feel-good story. That was the media ratio, and the secret to growing an audience and running a successful news business with paying advertisers.   \n\nJohn suddenly jerks to his feet.  \n\nDanny figures he lost reception, again as he observes John approach the TV. He fiddles with two long antennas, smacks the side of the story-box, then sits back down and sips on a warm glass of milk as he takes in the horrors of the world in the safety and security of his home.  \n\nDanny makes a note on his yellow pad about the TV. He could probably use it in his final design along with the refrigerator. As he considers the possibilities of building tension, a bead of sweat drips off his nose and splats on the pen. He wipes his face with his arm wishing he had the money to repair his air conditioner. Then he realizes he’ll complete his design soon, and his story, and with his story a paycheck. But the important thing is to not rush the design or miss out on the opportunities he knows time and patience will bring his dark imagination.  ",

He’ll start with the refrigerator door. The warning chime will sound in exactly three minutes to wake John up. He’ll slump down the stairs, close the door and quickly return to sleep, still thinking about the poor, unsuspecting bastard that was crushed to death by the escalator in the Roseville Mall. A perfect story to help John fall asleep, counting his lucky stars that it wasn’t him. That he’s still alive. And yet, completely oblivious to the fact that those are the last of his stars and that he will be tomorrow’s bedtime story. \n\nJust as John tries to fall asleep Danny will open the refrigerator door, again. And again, John will return to the kitchen. He’ll close it. But this time he’ll wait a few minutes just to make absolutely sure it’s really, really closed. Then he’ll return to bed somewhat satisfied that he won’t be disturbed anymore. \n\nDanny will let some time pass. Then he’ll open the door again, and when John returns to the kitchen, he’ll be in the living room to turn on the TV. This is precisely when John will wonder if there’s an intruder in his home. He may even suspect— \n\nThe Ghost of Roseville. \n\nThe Ghost Face. \n\nThe Legend. \n\nJohn will rush to the phone only to discover a severed cord. At that precise moment, he’ll leap out of the shadows like a panther in the night and trigger the first and final scream of John Michaels— \n\nThe most upstanding citizen of Roseville and the most undeserving of such a grisly and unprovoked death. \n\nIt’s perfect. \n\nIn the hot and humid sedan Danny visualizes slipping the knife through John’s neck and severing the tongue mid-scream—freezing his face in wide, gaping terror. He knows if he visualizes the kill several times it will improve his odds at success. His father taught him that. Taught him to visualize every beat of the design. He assured him it was what made him a medal-winning hunter of human beings. The thing they don’t teach you in killing school. \n\nDanny visualizes the design once more. Then he opens his eyes and exits the car, moving through the shadows toward the back door of the picture-perfect house. He glides past the fence and scans the backyard for a moment. Then he lifts and fiddles with the glass door until he hears a click. Carefully, he slides the door open and enters the air-conditioned home. \n\nHe takes a moment to cool down in the narrow hallway. Then he moves toward the dark kitchen, slowly opening the refrigerator door and enjoying a nice cool waft of air in the process. A soft beam of warm, yellow light illuminates the floor and the small round breakfast table beside him. \n\nEverything is going as planned. But then, as Danny turns, something in his peripheral catches his eye. Gives him pause. He tilts his head slightly, narrows his gaze and pulls off his mask to make sure he’s seeing what he thinks he’s seeing. As he takes in the horror spread across the table, his face freezes in a silent scream. ",

He lifts the front page of ‘The Urban Farce’ and examines a caricature of his legend based on police descriptions taken from an intoxicated witness he had deliberately spared during his last design. He wants to slowly build an image in the imaginations of his readers and now…  \n\n…Now a bunch of idiots were making a complete joke of his creation with parody. With god damn parody! The worst genre that ever existed. A bloated parasite that fed off the creations of others!    \n\nHow dare they make a joke of his life’s work!  \n\nDanny breathes hard and tries to compose himself. He realizes he can’t go through with tonight’s design. Too many emotions swirling around, undermining his focus. Anger. Hate. Humiliation. Disbelief. Everything feels hazy. Hazy and emotional like his first design.  \n\nThose were different circumstances. But his first design taught him how emotion can undermine even the best design. He quickly turns to close the refrigerator door, but he’s already too late and—  \n\nA piercing chime sounds through the small house.  \n\nShit!  \n\nDanny quickly retreats into the darkness of the pantry leaving the door slightly ajar.   \n\nWithin moments, John enters the kitchen yawning. He stands before the refrigerator scratching his head, confused. He yawns, again, and stares at leftovers, contemplating a little midnight snack. Then, mumbling something incoherent to himself, he closes the refrigerator door leaving them in the shadows.  \n\nHe should leave now. Go back to bed. But— \n\nJohn doesn’t leave.  \n\nHe just stands there as though sensing something’s amiss.  \n\nDanny can see John’s silhouette through the slight opening. It seems like John is approaching him, but he can’t be sure.  His heart pounds in his throat. His blood boils through his veins. He feels weak, light-headed, almost like he’s going to faint. This can’t be happening.  \n\nHe doesn’t just kill.  \n\nHe designs.  \n\nA dark shadow approaches the pantry.  \n\nDanny gathers himself and prepares to lunge with his knife.

Had John opened that pantry door Danny would have had no choice but to end his days as an awe-inspiring teacher. But he didn’t, and he gave Danny a chance to escape with The Urban Farce.  \n\nNow Danny stares through binoculars at the post office waiting for the editors or artists to show up. He needs to act fast and put a stop to this overt assault on his image. Parody. It had to be parody. God damn parody. The artist took a few vague statements about a ghost-like figure with a gaping mouth and turned those perfectly crafted statements into a joke. An absolute joke. Now, more than ever, he realizes that he’ll have to get a proper likeness of his terrifying mask out to the public before everything he’s worked toward is undone by a caricature.  \n\nAnd what if this parody is all that people remember? \n\nWon’t happen. I’ve collected them all.  \n\nHe turns to a massive stack of newspapers in the back seat of his car. He must have spent the entire night collecting every single copy of The Urban Farce from phone booths around the neighborhood.  \n\nHe scrunches his fist into a ball, sighs heavily and doesn’t understand the humor. There’s nothing funny about what he does. He provides a kind of misunderstood therapy for those suffering from the madness of suburban living. He makes the citizens of Roseville feel good about their monotonous lives. He gives them respite and relief. He protects the mask of civilization with his mask, and they’re laughing at that. Just like they laughed at his father when he returned.  \n\nHe grinds his teeth.  \n\nOnly trust fund idiots trying to be rebellious would publish this kind of shit.  \n\nA person enters the post office. Danny tracks him with the binoculars to box—  \n\n19. \n\nNot the publisher.   \n\nHe then follows another man to box—  \n\n7. \n\nHim neither.   \n\nAnd yet another man accesses box— \n\n15.  \n\nHe lowers the binoculars and calms his humiliated heart. He regards the newspaper one more time. Letters to the editor. He scans the address and notes the PO Box.  Then he looks up and suddenly spots a young man walking into the post office.

All of them—Tom, Pete, and Bradley—college dropouts working for Tom’s dad at the Coliseum. They’ll sweep the floor, take inventory, hang out in the staff room and work on their garbage newspaper, using dad’s photocopier. Then they’ll finish the night with one or two beers and a quick round of laser tag. Spoiled little shits with nothing better to do with their lives than drink and debate movies and distract their peanut brains with arcades and laser tag. But still—  \n\nHe’s grateful for their names.  \n\nPerfect names.  \n\nThey’re the kind of names you’d expect in a blockbuster. A ridiculous story where Tom, Pete, and Bradley enter an ‘extreme situation’ to kill all the badies only to return home without a scratch.  \n\nWithout a goddamn scratch.  \n\nAgainst technologically superior enemy.  \n\nNow that would be parody if it weren’t propaganda.  \n\nThe kind of propaganda that convinces all the Toms and Petes and Brads to sign up to kill human beings. The kind of story his dad hated because of how much he respected the actual badies who hunted him for all those years. The true story is—  \n\nPete and Bradley don’t come back home.  \n\nThey die.  \n\nHorrible deaths.  \n\nAnd Tom has to return to a suburban town that no longer accepts him because he sees right through the mask and it just doesn’t fit him anymore. And because it doesn’t fit anymore, they’ll sweep him under the rug of civilization and try to forget him because of the truth he represents. And Tom will stare at the perfectly manicured lawns and the white picket fences and know. And always know— \n\nIt’s all a façade. \n\nDanny watches the laughing, intoxicated three stooges enter the staff room.  \n\nGo ahead, laugh. You’ll soon realize what happens when you cross lines that shouldn’t be crossed.  \n\nDanny feels acid rising up his throat. He tells himself he will soon have the last laugh. The challenge of this design is to overcome his bubbling rage. And he feels he’s almost ready. He just has to go through the Coliseum and search for the most ideal place for the perfect scream. For now, he’s leaning toward the staff room, but he knows that might change once he’s actually walked the space.  ",

Danny stands in the shadows away from the bright street lights, observing them through a glass door. When they disappear into the staff room, he puts on his beloved, bone-white mask and prepares for his first walk through of the setting. He’ll walk through the Coliseum at least two more times before he finalizes the design, allowing his ideas to work themselves out. \n\nTime to incubate is the secret to any great design. \n\nAnd it’s the phase he knows not to rush. It’s the most important phase. Everything else is just execution. \n\nDanny laughs at his pun as he glides through the darkness toward the exit door. How often did he have issues with his design only to be struck by inspiration in the middle of the night? He knows now that if he has any creative blocks he just has to sleep on it. There’s something about sleep that polishes every design. \n\nNow Danny opens the exit door which he tinkered with earlier in the day. Stealthily, he enters the arcade, gliding past the small concessions booth toward the growing sound of a debate. He hides near the staff room where he hears the loud and obnoxious stooges argue over horror movies and killers. \n\nDanny suddenly feels the blood rushing up his neck as they get everything wrong. Idiots poking fun at something they don’t understand, or, at best, think they understand. Idiots criticizing some of the greatest designs and spewing vitriol about how they could have done better. So much better. Tom even suggests that they should work together to create a design of their own. Give Roseville something to be really scared of. \n\nDanny clenches a fist and wants to rush inside the staff room and rip their heads off. He takes a moment to calm himself. In a week or so he’ll have his moment with these arrogant idiots. The intellectual masturbation of those who shout from the sidelines and wonder what it’s like to actually step into the ring. They exist in every creative field. He knows that, and laughs at himself for actually letting them get in his head. He’d actually love to see the stooges attempt their own design. They would fumble and fuck up every beat up to the very climax. He almost wants to spare them just to see what they’d end up doing. \n\nAlmost. \n\nDanny regards his watch. One minute more. He counts the seconds as they complain and spew hot air about the perfect design and how they alone could execute it. The boasting and bravado fades and is quickly replaced with rock-and-roll blasting on the Coliseum speakers. \n\nWith quick steps, Danny retreats behind a beeping arcade as the idiots spill out of the staff room and enter the laser tag arena for a quick fix of adrenaline. He quietly steps out of the shadows and counts ten paces to the staff room. He has exactly twenty-two minutes before their game ends. \n\nHe opens the door and enters the tiny room but unexpectedly gags when he’s hit with the foul stench of stale beer, rancid coffee, and twisted cigarette butts in dirty ashtrays. He turns to his side slightly, and his eyes suddenly go wide beneath the mask. \n\nWhat the fuck! \n\nHis heart thunders in his ears as he stares at a yellowing wall covered with caricatures of his favorite killers throughout history. His face tenses. He grinds his molars and tries to suppress the thing beneath the mask. He needs to take a moment, compose himself, and walk away. \n\nDon’t look at it. Just don’t look at it… \n\nBut he can’t help himself. You don’t laugh at legends… \n\nHe reaches out and touches a caricature of the one they called The Miner. You don’t laugh at legends… His mouth gapes open. His lips tremble. He hasn’t felt like this in years. \n\nYou don’t! Laugh! At legends! \n\nHe tries to turn away but his feet are blocks of cement. He feels prickles all over his body as blood courses violently through his veins and something contained begins to stir. \n\nHe closes his eyes and counts to ten. He hasn’t improvised since his first design and that didn’t go very well. He has to find his center. \n\nWalk away. \n\nJust walk away. \n\nFor the design. \n\nHe stares up at the wall of parody and takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes and counts down from ten. Then he opens his eyes to see all the warped and ridiculous faces laughing at him. \n\nHe wants to ignore them. He wants to walk away. He has to walk away. But something won’t let him. And before he realizes what’s happening the thing contained breaks free. He clenches his fist and smashes it against the wall. \n\nFuck the design! ",

Cranking up the music. Activating the dry ice machine. Hunting the three stooges in slow motion through the cool, misty arena. And now he yanks the gleaming hunter knife out of a pulpy face rendered completely unrecognizable. \n\nShit. I must have stabbed him a hundred times in the head. \n\nDanny narrows his gaze on the face but the strobe light plays tricks on him. Makes the face look like his past victims—the faces changing with every blink of light. \n\nHe shakes his head and stares hard at the face. This is Tom. No. Can’t be. Tom he stabbed in the legs. He’s still alive, groveling about like a worm somewhere. \n\nWhat about Pete? No. Can’t be, Pete. He’s pretty sure he decapitated Pete. It’s not what he intended, but shit happens. He pushed the knife a little too hard. Cut a little too deep. A little too fiercely. \n\nWell, if it isn’t Pete. And it isn’t Tom. It must be Bradley. Good’ol Bradley. He’s confronted with a sudden image of Bradley screaming as he silences him with a blade through the mouth. He nods and sighs. Yeah, it’s Bradley. Definitely, Bradley. \n\nHe stares at the mangled face for a long moment. It’s not as bad as he thought it would be. A little messy, but he can find a way to make this work. \n\nThe last time he improvised a design was with his dad. Bless his soul. He deserved a better design, a much better execution, but he hadn’t realized how much he had bottled up inside. All those training drills and unrealistic expectations to bring back stories and medals pushed him over the edge. \n\nIt just came pouring out one night while camping in a way he hadn’t expected. Happens all the time. Every day. To the best. He just didn’t think it could happen to him. And here it is happening again. \n\nThe music stops for a moment to reveal someone sobbing and screaming for help. \n\nTom. \n\nDanny marches through flashing light and dark, following a trail of warm blood through the maze. Soon the blood leads him to a young man dragging himself across the cement ground, desperately inching toward an exit door. \n\nDanny approaches him menacingly. He kneels before him and stares at him. Despite the air-conditioning he feels sweat drip down his face and drip into the gathering pool of blood. And as he watches the sweat drip off his face, he realizes— \n\nHe isn’t wearing his mask. He touches his warm, bloody face and vaguely remembers removing the mask in the staff room after her ripped down every last caricature. \n\nThat’s because The Ghost Face has nothing to do with this. This is something else. There’s no way he’s crediting The Ghost Face with these clumsy yet incredibly satisfying kills. \n\nTom looks up at Danny. \n\nDanny wipes the sweat and blood off his face. They lock eyes. \n\nNot so funny now, is it? \n\nDanny places his knife in Tom’s hand. \n\nYou know what a copycat is, don’t you? Well, that’s what you are. A failed copycat. A parody of a true killer. \n\nTom tries to attack Danny with the knife. \n\nEasy there, Tom. You might hurt yourself… \n\nTom’s arm falls and splatters in blood, the knife dangling from the fingertips. He struggles to wrap his wet fingers around the hilt and attacks with the knife, hitting air over and over again. \n\nDanny laughs. Politicians will use your story to campaign against beer, rock-and-roll and horror movies. That’s the current angle I’m considering. You like that angle, Tom? \n\nTom gasps and struggles to say something without success. \n\nDanny inches closer. He lowers his voice to a cruel whisper and suggests a potential headline for his next article— \n\nGhost Copycat. Tragedy hits Roseville Coliseum. Employee stabs two of his colleagues to death before suffering a lethal injury. \n\nDanny considers, then offers an alternative version— \n\nJoke taken too far. Tragedy hits Roseville Coliseum. Three employees die in a prank gone horribly wrong after a night of drinking, rock-and-roll and horror movies. \n\nDanny tilts his head slightly. He considers both versions of the story. The drinking, rock-and-roll and horror movies offer a comfortable scapegoat. It gives readers something to point to. \n\nSomething to blame. \n\nA place to hide. \n\nAnd he isn’t sure he wants to give his readers a place to hide with this one. He leans closer to Tom. What do you think? Copycat or bad joke? \n\nTom murmurs something incoherent. \n\nDanny smiles. Sorry, I didn’t really get that. You’re gonna have to speak up, buddy. Take a deep breath… enunciate. Come on… you’re so full of fuckin' opinions… I’m sure you have an opinion on how you’d like to be remembered. \n\nTom writhes desperately and manages to issue one last, gasping scream before dying. \n\nDanny sighs and closes his eyes against the blinking light. He still isn’t sure which angle to take, and it doesn’t really matter, anyway. Either version will do its job and scare the good citizens of Roseville into fastening the mask a little tighter before bed while they count their lucky stars and appreciate their ridiculously insane, suburban lives.

Her otherworldliness. \n\nEven in this dark, dangerous place, she seems more connected to the flora. To the trees. The shrubs. The night blooming flowers. The climbing vines. The crickets chirping their night song. The moths drawn to the tiny pockets of light that penetrate the heavy black fog. The rats scurrying through the brush. She can sit for hours watching a spider spin its web. That’s what holds her interest. The living things that somehow continue to thrive in this grim and wicked place. \n\nShe can’t read people the way others can. She can’t look at someone’s face and understand what they’re feeling. The language of human emotion is indecipherable. Her kind, intelligent eyes are framed by big plastic glasses. Her complexion is dark. Her jet black hair a soft, beautiful cloud of tightly coiled curls and braids.  \n\nShe moves through the dark mist and her skin prickles with fear. There are dangers in this place. Predators. Monsters. The stench of death. The sickly sweet aroma of rotten flesh. The air is damp. Cold. \n\nThe crickets suddenly stop chirping. The abrupt silence stops her in her tracks. She waits. Listens. Holds her breath. \n\nA guttural roar rips the air behind her. \n\nWhen she turns, she sees a scarred and misshapen face. A monster wielding a thundering chain saw. Terrified crows bolt from the trees. Mikaela screams along with the woman and awakens with a start, covered in sweat, lying in the dark. \n\nA nightmare. ",

You’re running from your fear. \n\nSo why am I someone else? \n\nBecause you’re a writer. \n\nShe shakes her head. No. I’m a storyteller. \n\nWhat’s the difference? \n\nBig difference. \n\nOkay, whatever… You’re a storyteller. And as a storyteller you’re all your characters. You live inside them. They live inside you. That doesn’t mean you’re experiencing another reality. \n\nBut what if I’m not really a storyteller? \n\nYou’re just fishing for a compliment. \n\nNo. I’m serious, maybe I’m just a hack. \n\nMik, come on, take it easy on yourself. You just have to let go. Take a chance. Dive off the edge. Headfirst into that fog you keep talking about. Face that fear and it will no longer chase you. \n\nI don’t think it ever stops. \n\nJulian stands with a laugh. Alright. I’m officially late for work now. \n\nHe rushes out the door. Mikaela finishes her tea, then jumps in the shower. \n\nShe does her best thinking in the shower. And as the hot water pounds her back she thinks about what Julian said. \n\nAre her nightmares messages from her subconscious? Carl Jung believed that our subconscious connects to a collective unconscious that binds every human soul to primal symbols and ancient archetypes. That’s why so many fears and phobias are universal. Why so many cultures have the same stories and mythologies. \n\nHer muscles loosen under the hot spray and she remembers a writing circle where they talked about something called Dejavuism. The idea being that human brains could network with mirror beings on the same wavelength in other dimensions. One guy in the group thought that his inner voice was just another version of himself in a parallel dimension. Others in the circle laughed. She didn’t. She even shared one of her stories based on a recurring nightmare. \n\nThe hot water loses its heat and Mikaela suddenly turns it off just as she’s struck by an epiphany. What if she’s dreaming real things in a sort of multiverse? What if this world made of nightmares is not a plane of existence separate from the daily reality we all experience? What if it’s just one of many realities all existing at the same time. And if there are indeed multiple realities, it occurs to her that every story she creates while asleep or awake might simply be a glimpse into another plane of existence. \n\nMikaela shivers with excitement. Maybe all the stories already exist and are just waiting for her to discover them. Maybe writing should be less about torturing and judging herself and more about opening herself up to the possibilities within the garden of infinity. ",

Thrilled to experience another reality in the infinitude of the multiverse. \n\nA dark castle courtyard. Skewered corpses surround a sobbing man. He’s on his knees in the dirt as a black fog pulls back, revealing even more bloody corpses. He screams a name. \n\nThe screaming man doesn’t wear medieval garb. He wears jeans. A black t-shirt. Running shoes. Mikaela sees others now. Some wear headphones and carry clipboards. \n\nThe stonework is actually painted wood. The ramparts are cardboard. The corpses are manikins decorated to look like the dead. She sees lights. A camera. A sobbing man who’s facing his greatest fear: the loss of someone he deeply loves. Taken by the darkness. Taken by the fog— \n\nAlways the fog. \n\nMikaela awakens with a start, but this time she isn’t gripped by terror. She’s seized by inspiration. She searches her drawer for a piece she started writing years ago. She finds the first draft and re-works it while the images are fresh in her mind. The story pours out of her like she’s taking dictation. Like she’s writing down something that already happened. \n\nBecause it did. \n\nBut when Mikaela reads the story aloud, it still sounds wordy. Prosaic. Clunky. There’s no rhythm. No shape. No build. No vivid moments to perform. There’s something wrong. Something blocking her. And she quickly understands what it is. She still unconsciously follows those rules— \n\nThose suffocating rules that were pounded endlessly into her head throughout her years at school. And now the story doesn’t flow. Doesn’t feel alive. Feels contrived. Heavy. Dead. And why? Because she still hesitates to break rules that were never rules in the first place. \n\nShit! What’s going on with me? Why can’t I do it? \n\nMikaela hurries into the living room and picks up a few of her favorite books. They all break the rules. All of them. Every writer she ever loved. Twain. Faulkner. Dickens. Poe. Brandies would have given them all F's in his class. And she can’t even imagine what he would have done with quippy, young Shakespeare. \n\nShakespeare who was free from the shackles of the mind placed by processed teachers and assembly-line thinking. Shakespeare who was free to create his own rules and words without apology. Who wasn’t worried about what some authority or critic had to say, and they had tons to say. And Mikaela knows his freedom was earned after a terrible bout with depression when his first play flopped and he refused to touch a quill for five years. \n\nFive years! \n\nIt took him five years to mediate on storytelling to finally break free from the opinions of others. \n\nBut she doesn’t have five years to meditate on storytelling even though she desperately wants— \n\nShakespearean freedom! \n\nHow do I achieve that kind of freedom after all those years of trying to please others? \n\nShakespeare made his own words and rules and that’s why he’s immortal. \n\nBut I don’t need to be immortal. I just need to tell a good story. \n\nMikaela clears her head of the swirling negativity and decides to tell the story she wants to tell. She’ll need to reduce the story. Strip it to its core. Cut anything that slows it down. Change the passive to the active. Use words that paint perfect images in the imagination. And if she doesn’t have the right word, she’ll make one up. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll make one up! But as the rebellious thought inspires her, it also scares her. Scares the hell out of her because she was taught to idolize final results instead of the struggle, the search, and the climatic fight every artist must go through to be free. \n\nTo be truly free. \n\nThe shackles are still there. She feels them dragging her down, but they’re not as heavy as they used to be. And though she may not possess Shakespearean freedom yet— \n\nShe can fake it. \n\nFor now. \n\nAnd now, she rises to her feet and paces the living room as she recites the first draft of her story. She finds places for dramatic pauses. Places to add a gesture. Places to speed up. Places to shock the audience into gasping or screaming. She won’t just play to them, she’ll play with them. And she won’t just tell the story, she’ll live the story, so the audience lives it with her. ",

Honed every word. Every moment. Every movement. Every breath. She killed her darlings. Anything extraneous. All that’s left is only what’s necessary to tell the tale. \n\nShe moves across the tiny stage, commanding the room. The lights dim slowly. She waits until the audience goes quiet. Then she clears her throat and begins. \n\nWho here believes in love? I mean really believes in love? \n\nSome audience members lift their hand or make a quick comment that they do. \n\nMikaela nods. \n\nLove makes us do crazy things, doesn’t it? \n\nSeveral audience members laugh and while others seem to go inward. \n\nMikaela smiles. \n\nSome would turn their back on family for love. Some would give up wealth and power for love. Some would even go to hell and back for love. But there are places in the cosmos far worse than hell. Places where death is just the beginning, and you could lose your soul.  \n\nWould you go to such a place to bring back the one you love? \n\nMikaela stops and points at one audience member, and then another, and another. \n\nDo you know anyone who would?

A few of us gathered around a small fire in the study and told stories about loved ones we’ve all heard a hundred times but acted like it’s the first time. I suppose that’s because we know it helps to talk, laugh and remember the good times. Ahma told us about her little girl building motorcycle engines—upgrading scooters and racing them in her small village. This version was a little more embellished than the last. No one can be that good on a scooter even if it had been modified or upgraded with plane parts. Nevertheless, they were amusing stories, and she told them well up until the moment she stopped abruptly, staring blankly at the fire, lost in a memory. No one said anything for a long while. I stared at the leaping flames and thought of the time you first learned to ride a bicycle. You were four years old and the first thing I taught you was how to fall. I told you to push yourself with your feet and fall safely to the left or right side. We practiced falling safely until the fear of falling was gone. Then I showed you how to pedal fast and use the speed to keep your balance. You succeeded on your first try because you were no longer scared of falling. You were so happy you jumped off your bike, hugged me and told me I was the best dad in the world. If I were to die today and live in that moment forever I would be a blessed man. I miss you with all my heart and hate what happened between us. I only hope for another chance to make things right. ",

He wiped the cold sweat from his brow, opened the creaking door and entered the dark lobby. At once his heart sank as he stared upon a grim scene of death. Strewn across the floor were human corpses and the decaying remains of squid-like creatures, unlike anything he had ever seen before. He took a moment to compose himself. His bruised face, swollen feet and tattered clothes gave testament to the long and arduous journey through this dark dimension to find his adopted sister, Haley. Back home, he had connected with others who had lost loved ones in similar circumstances and together they had collected relics and artifacts with secret symbols that eventually helped them open a portal into this world made of nightmares. But no sooner had they entered the nightmare than they had been separated while being attacked by a shadow creature with an insatiable appetite for darkness. \n\nNow Jaden was alone. Without the research—or the ‘codex’ as some of them had grown accustomed to calling it—he wasn’t sure how he would escape when he found his sister. But he tried not to think about his predicament as he entered the lobby feeling like something or someone was watching him. Some distance away he had found the ruins of a tower with skeletons strewn across a mini-putt with an old French song playing on a scratchy gramophone. Now he was in an abandoned motel, reeking dead creatures around him. He didn’t know what else to expect, but he was sure of one thing: more deadly creatures and mysterious ruins would be in the fog. Much more. Everything he had discovered about this world suggested it was a garden of infinite darkness beyond time and space. \n\nDeath—he had read—was not an escape. \n\nCautiously, Jaden walked down a deathly silent corridor with shaking hands toward a door. Above the door an exit sign blinked in and out of existence. The only sign of life was a rat the size of a dog chewing on the putrid flesh of one of the bloated squid creatures. As he passed a pile of bodies, he felt something behind him. He turned to see a sudden flash. An instant later he was staring down the edge of a gleaming katana. He gasped as he found himself staring at a woman in a red and black kimono. She reminded him of a protagonist in a story Haley had been collecting by an anonymous eighteenth century Japanese author. \n\n“Saku, wait!” \n\nJaden’s heart gave a great leap as he instantly recognized Surin’s voice. He turned to see several other familiar faces amongst a small group of survivors. Beyond the faces he recognized—Olivia, Sean and Elias—he thought he saw Haley’s estranged uncle, Mahan, in blood-stained fatigues, carrying a semi-automatic rifle. \n\nSurin urgently turned to face a woman beside him. “Ariella,” he said. “Tell Saku we know him. His name is Jaden. He came with us through the portal but we got separated. This place… it has his sister.” \n\nAriella nodded, then gently placed her hand on Saku’s wrist, translating Surin’s words into Japanese. Within moments, Saku nodded her understanding and lowered her katana. \n\nJaden breathed again as Surin tossed him a rifle and a rusty machete, then introduced him to the new members of the group and told everyone to prepare for another assault from the fog. An instant later they dispersed to barricade and fortify the motel. ",

One bearded prisoner sat up and stared at several names etched in a rock by the door. It read: \n\nAmar Singh 1914 \n\nAdama Comba 1915 \n\nOmar Halimi 1916 \n\nAmrik 1917 \n\nRup 1917 \n\nThe prisoner had the sudden instinct to etch his own name lest he be forgotten. And so, he grabbed a small, sharp stone and just as he began to etch out his name, the thick wooden door slammed open and enemy soldiers shouted curses at the five prisoners in a language none of them understood while threatening them with gleaming bayonets. \n\nThe enemy soldiers gestured for them to stand, then ushered the five prisoners out of the darkness and into the golden light of dawn through a muddy, six-foot trench reeking of death. \n\nAs the prisoners hobbled toward a clearing, one soldier addressed them in broken English, telling them they had the honor of helping their captain and perhaps avoiding early morning target practice. \n\n* \n\nTHE FIVE PRISONERS stood by the trench wall as an enemy soldier balanced tin cans over their heads. A translator approached them with the captain. The captain spoke, and the translator quickly interpreted, saying: \n\n“One of you bastards will tell me about your secret mission. Speak up and I promise to send you to a proper camp where you will be fed and given immediate medical attention.” \n\nNone of the five responded. The captain smirked, took twenty paces back, cocked his rifle, aimed and hit one soldier in the forehead, splitting his skull in two, sending a spray of blood across the other four. \n\nThe captain regarded them, hesitated, then cocked the rifle again. A sudden crack and another prisoner fell as the captain mockingly apologized for his terrible aim. \n\nWith a laugh, the captain aimed the rifle, squeezed the trigger, and hit the tin can. The can fell against the sandbags lining of the trench and clattered against debris. The captain prepared his rifle and shifted his aim to the next prisoner. \n\nThe prisoner stared at the rifle, closed his eyes, and repeated a phrase in an unknown language that resembled Latin. And just as the captain made to pull the trigger, a sudden piercing whistle suddenly caught everyone’s attention. By the time the captain looked up, it was already too late, and he was reduced to fleshy fragments and bone shrapnel by an eighteen-pounder. \n\n* \n\nTHE BEARDED PRISONER CRAWLED on the ground toward a trembling hand sticking out of a pile of debris. He frantically dug through the dirt and rubble as muffled screams and explosions filled his ears. Breathing hard, he managed to dig out one face and then another. Then he rose on shaking legs, grabbed one prisoner by the uniform and pulled him to his feet. Together they yanked the other prisoner from a mountain of rubble and took a moment to gather themselves. Limping and coughing, they grabbed rifles from the ground, rushed toward a ladder and climbed over the trench and into the barren wasteland. \n\nLeaping over decomposing horses, bullets thumped in the mud all around the fleeing prisoners as they fell into a massive crater. As they desperately scrambled out, jumping over bodies and rats and pushing through clouds of flies, they suddenly and unexpectedly entered a maze of barbed wire attached to the scorched remains of trees. Pushing their way out of the maze, they once again entered a clearing and sprinted away without looking back until— \n\nThey heard the rumble of an engine in the sky. \n\nThey turned to see the plane. One prisoner froze, grabbed his rifle and aimed as the plane approached them. Holding his breath, he pulled the trigger and large crows took flight from corpses as the bullet screamed through the air and— \n\nMissed. \n\nHe cocked the rifle again, calmed his nerves, and waiting for the right moment, squeezed the trigger. This time the bullet howled through the sky and hammered straight through the pilot’s hardened face. \n\nA moment later the plane rose, then span wildly out of control. \n\nThe prisoners watched in disbelief as the plane crashed into their pursuers, crushing and cutting and burning them up in a swirling ball of fire. \n\nAs they took in the grisly scene, the world seemed to tremble violently and the ground beneath their feet instantly disappeared. The three prisoners fell, arms flailing, into a massive sink hole as dust, soot and barbed wire covered them. \n\n* \n\nWHEN THE DUST settled, the three prisoners surveyed their surroundings to discover they were in an ancient temple immersed in a strange black fog and arcane symbols etched in the surrounding walls. They had inadvertently discovered the lost temple they had been sent out to find before the secret enemy units that had been created to secure hidden occult knowledge all over the world. Now all they had to do was report their discovery to the newly formed Intelligence Division. \n\nAnd so the prisoners desperately climbed out of the temple and found themselves in familiar yet unfamiliar territory. The bleak, body-ridden landscape seemed like No Man’s Land, but there was something strange about the scene. All around were mazelike walls of barbed wire and scorched trees where bodies dangled from hooks that glistened red under a hunter’s moon. Each prisoner stared at the bodies and the hooks confused, each wondering if they had been there before. \n\nThe sudden high-pitch buzz of a chainsaw startled the prisoners, and they instinctively took cover beside a burning tank. As a cloud of heaving black fog approached them, they knew something was different with the hell they had grown accustomed to for the last three years. \n\nThey sensed that they had somehow discovered something lost and forgotten to time in the hidden temple, or that this lost and forgotten thing had somehow discovered them and that this thing, this ancient thing—whatever it was—had pushed them out of the frying pan and into the cosmic fire.

    "B963A3AA4CFB6E1C444A73B0223B7AD2": "As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth’s warmth, Anna would rest in her mother’s arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and lullabies, she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would soon change everything.<br><br>Anna and her mother were stalking a great elk through the woods. They knew it was dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult winter and they were almost out of food. The specter of starvation frightened them more than any forest creature. Without warning, the elk reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She was paralyzed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under the immense beast's pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A bloodcurdling scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted her into the air. With all her strength, she brought her axe down on its head again and again while it tried to shake her loose. With a sickening crack, the antlers snapped and Anna's mother was free. The beast collapsed.<br><br>Anna was too small to move her mother's broken body, so she sat with her in the clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk's cries, Anna's mother held her and hummed her favorite lullaby. They stayed like that, the huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk back home.<br><br>Still a child, she knew just enough about life in the frozen forest to survive. She followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got older and stronger and practiced her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator, her humanity became a half-remembered dream.<br><br>She widened her territory and lived off her hunts. She worked her way up through squirrels and hares and mink and foxes. Eventually she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like wolves and bears. When unsuspecting travelers came through her woods, she discovered her new favorite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and colorful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill the little girls.<br><br>Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn’t read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the wall. She couldn’t let them wander off, or they would surely die outside.<br><br>Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.<br><br>War eventually came to the forest. German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. During these dark times, there were no more travelers. The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest.",

Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the Killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the Killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by Killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.",

Survivors may also choose to stay in the trial and help other Survivors escape, but the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> will require they leave before the timer expires, or else The Entity will take them forcefully. Taking the risk of staying for others in need is a great way to earn more Bloodpoints and a good reputation.",

    "1C1280F946154BEE89B274BF3673A1CA": "To understand the human condition, one must rise above it. This was the credo of Talbot Grimes, a Scottish chemist whose unrestrained ambition took him to towering heights. As a boy, he was a popular child—bright, charismatic, and unafraid to challenge authority—yet despite his social graces he was fiercely independent, spending much of his time exploring the sprawling fields near his town alone. What began as a child's curiosity nearly turned deadly after experimenting with a patch of poisonous foxglove. For days, he laid in bed dripping with sweat, purging any food that touched his stomach. When he recovered, it wasn't fear that gripped him, but fascination. There was something magical in how a single flower could so drastically affect him.<br><br>Into his adult years, his ambition developed as quickly as his questionable methods. He attended the London School of Medicine and excelled despite several reprimands. His willingness to push the limits secured him a position with the British East India Company, and within seven years he was made head chemist. In time, he completed one of his greatest achievements: a chemical that could increase a worker's productivity while reducing their need for rest. He was rewarded with a secret laboratory beneath a prison camp on Dyer Island.<br><br>There, off the coast of India, prisoners from the Opium War became his unwilling subjects, leading to a drug that allowed soldiers to withstand incredible amounts of pain. Though most side effects were minor, there were rumors that a small number of soldiers went mad. In feral states, they massacred villages, impaling the populace on bayonets, leaving them hanging from trees. There were no official reports on the subject, and Talbot refused to blame himself for what could only be exaggerated war stories.<br><br>Though his callous brilliance seemed unflappable, he was ignorant to the enemies his questionable work had amassed. The realization struck him quite literally—with a steel pipe to the back of his head during a trip to Mangalore. He was bound and loaded into a wagon. When his blindfold was removed, a sickly man showed him a mass grave filled with hundreds of bodies. Unbeknownst to Talbot, his productivity-increasing drug had killed nearly an entire factory's worth of workers. He knew he couldn't defend himself against the anger and accusations of his abductor—all he could do was curl up as the blows from the steel pipe rained down. His body was thrown into the grave and left for dead. Shifting between consciousness and the darkest black, he crawled for an escape, fingers sinking into rotting flesh. Black flies feasted on his uncovered skin, the sensation of a hundred pin pricks stabbing into him. As he collapsed, he came face to face with a dead woman’s dazzling hazel eyes. Too weak to pull away, he could do nothing but witness his life’s work.<br><br>Then, from the edge of death, he was brought back. He found himself on a small bed as a kindly, wrinkled face looked over him. With each pained breath, he was nursed back to health in an ancient mystery school posing as a monastery. In verdant gardens behind tall, unassuming walls, monks studied forbidden texts, striving to expand the human mind in the search for other dimensions—believing one to be connected to the other.<br><br>Talbot’s knowledge proved indispensable, his mind-altering chemicals integrating seamlessly with theories of neural expansion. He realized then that his salvation was no coincidence—he was plucked from the pit specifically to advance the school’s knowledge. He agreed to help until his recovery was complete, being tasked with researching what the monk’s called the soul chemical, a compound derived from the pineal gland that could open the mind’s eye. What began as a favor to his saviors, soon became an obsession. Poring over the school’s archives of lost texts, he uncovered scientific formulas that confirmed previously unthinkable ideas. He dreamt of ushering humankind into a new period of enlightenment. Perhaps then, the nightmares of hundreds of dead factory workers—and of those two hazel eyes—would fade from his mind.<br><br>As he came closer to a breakthrough, the demeanor of the monks shifted. The gentle smiles they offered were paired with uneasy eyes that quickly darted away when spotted. The polite conversations he was once privy to turned to hushed murmurs. The last thing he would see of the school was the cracked ceiling above his bed, branching like a dendrite through plaster.<br><br>His next memories were a shattered mosaic of images and sensations. Smearing lights, horse hoofs on cobblestone, coarse burlap scratching at his cheeks, and sharp bites into his arm. He awoke ragged and unwashed, splayed on the straw mattress of an opium den. Mind in a dense fog, his first thought was of his notes, the only record of his groundbreaking revelations. He searched frantically, scrambling through the dingy basement, pleading aloud for help. The few other denizens looked up from their hammocks, offering nothing but drug-soaked eyes and apathetic gazes that soon fell into half-slumber. Before he noticed the robed figure appear behind him, a needle plunged into his arm and the world disappeared once more.<br><br>Awoken. Again. Each time, hazier than the last. He tongued at hollow gaps between his teeth. How long, he wondered. A faint memory returned. The soul chemical. His notes. The verge of a breakthrough. A faraway whisper entered his mind.<br><br>He fumbled with a stone, sharpening it with shaking hands. In the dim light of the den, amongst the catatonic occupants, he carved his research from memory into the walls. He wrote for hours until his fingers bled, moving to the floor, taking in everything the voice whispered despite his inability to comprehend it. When there was nowhere left to write, he gripped the stone and carved the message into his chest. Stained with blood, he witnessed a miracle appear before him—a magnificent field of lush, orange flowers. The whispered voice beckoned to him, urging him to enter the field and discover worlds and dimensions beyond human comprehension. For a moment, Talbot felt the sense of wonder he possessed as a child.<br><br>The denizens of the opium den awoke to silence, the dry scent of smoke still lingering in the air. Shambling out of their drug-hazed fog, they found the stone floor wet with blood, tiny rivulets coursing through the cracks. As eyes adjusted to the darkened room, the jagged lettering scrawled along its length began to appear. Written over and over without end, there was but one single line: <i>Death Is Only the Beginning</i>.",

    "E4EBD07D44CA6CA15BE34EADB861BD01": "A pair of conjoined twins, Charlotte and Victor Deshayes formed an emotional bond like none other. The unlikeliness of their successful birth in the 17th century could be described as miraculous, yet it immediately brought about their life of persecution. The twins emerged with Victor’s lower body affixed into the chest of his sister, legs twisted around her muscles and organs. He was smaller than Charlotte, grown as if he were an appendage of her body rather than a fully formed boy. As the newborns screeched, so too did the midwife who delivered them, running from the home, yelling of a demon birthed by a witch. So began the hunting of Charlotte, Victor, and their mother Madeleine.<br><br>The coming years were fleeting memories for the twins, yet they were the closest thing to a normal life they would know. The journey with their mother was what they believed all children underwent, the games of running and hiding through France’s countryside being an ordinary occurrence. At the age of five, a new challenge to the game was presented as their mother fell ill. Pale and exhausted, Madeleine had no choice but to pass responsibility of collecting food onto Charlotte. The girl, burdened under extra clothing that concealed Victor’s protruding body, set out from their forest tent and marched to the nearby town. Though a peculiar sight, she did what she had been trained for, waiting for an opening at the market and swiping whatever food she could. It was a victory in the game, but one short-lived.<br><br>After midnight, glowing flames surrounded the family’s encampment, bobbing through the darkness. A single commanding shout broke the night’s silence and a mob of witch hunters streamed in. Grubby hands tore the twins from their bed, Charlotte frantically kicking all who approached. Madeleine cried for her children, her voice abruptly silenced by a club to her skull. Victor shrieked, the wailings of a trapped rat.<br><br>The hunters coordinated quickly. A judge on hand declared Madeleine guilty of witchcraft, evidenced by her demon spawn. Within minutes, they shackled her unconscious body to a tree, surrounding her feet with dry twigs and moss. As she awoke, she did not struggle, only begged her children to turn away. They would be given no choice. The twins were forced to watch as the torch was lit, and they watched as flames leapt up their mother’s skirt, charring and sizzling her flesh. They watched as fat dripped from her body, and her face bubbled and twisted. They watched until the screams that tore her vocal cords were no more, and all that was left was the crackling of embers and a nauseating stench.<br><br>Whatever joy and goodness were in them died with their mother. Caged and transported to an old wooden temple, they were sold to a secretive group clad in dark cloaks. Victor reacted with the ferocity of a rabid beast at any who approached, clawing and biting. The only solace that could calm him was the embrace of his sister. Charlotte, bitter and hateful to all but her brother, found purpose in being his protector.<br><br>Within the temple, they were exposed to unusual experiments for years—some cruel, many simply baffling. One day they would be made to break the neck of a small grey bird. The next, they would bleed their fingers into a vase of roses. Every seventh day, they would sleep with the branch of a damp oak beneath their pillow. Then there was the chanting: a never-ending chorus from cloaked figures on scheduled intervals. <br><br>In time, a final experiment was planned. Two robed figures herded the twins to the center of the temple, holding Charlotte upon an altar in a room alit with candelabras. The wrinkled face of a man peered from under his hood, placing a hand on the forehead of each twin, making careful examination of their skulls. Memento mori, he uttered, as he withdrew a shining blade.<br><br>Charlotte rolled to her side, shifting her brother off the altar. With a screech, he stretched his arm as far as he could, knocking a candelabra to the ground. The flames took to the dry wood immediately. They swept over the floor, igniting the black robes that brushed against it. Screams of agony pierced the chaos, invigorating Charlotte. She dashed through the inferno, vision concealed with nothing but black smoke and blazing flame. A painful heaviness filled her lungs. No exit could be found, every step leading to overwhelming heat. She fell to her knees, suffocating, and then saw it—sunlight, trees. She stumbled from the fire into dewy grass. Without looking back, she ran into the forest until she collapsed.<br><br>When Charlotte opened her eyes, she reached for Victor’s hand. He made no attempt to budge. His body hung helplessly from her torso. She clasped his face, stared into his sad, still eyes. The movements she was accustomed to—his body pulling at her skin, his legs prodding at the cavity in her chest—were no more. Victor was dead.<br><br>Charlotte had no choice but to continue moving as she mourned, fearing black cloaks and witch hunters were prowling. She concealed her brother’s corpse under her clothing and marched for the sewers of a nearby city. There, she set up camp, emerging often to steal whatever food she could, resorting to raiding barns for pig slop when desperation set in. Throughout the years, Victor’s corpse rotted as his limbs oozed and blackened, yet his body demonstrated resistance to complete decomposition, as if his sister’s blood still coursed through him. Protecting his lifeless body became Charlotte’s sole reason for being, refusing to ever be separated from the only family she had left.<br><br>Life in her teenage years was a game of survival. Her hatred for humanity grew each day under the realization they would never leave her be. No matter how many died during her botched robberies and desperate attempts to escape, there would always be more to pursue and sling words of condemnation at her—monster, demon, witch. And it was the black cloaks who were the worst of them. Their hunt for her was unending, forcing her to constantly abandon shelter and run.<br><br>For years, Charlotte fled, drawing blood out of necessity, cradling her long-dead brother in the night. During a frigid winter, her body began to break down. Food was scarce and the refuge of rickety shacks were no use against freezing temperatures. Sickle in hand, she sheltered near her campfire in the woods, not knowing if the black cloaks would take her before the cold did. As frost crystalized around her nostrils and her lips took on a gentle blue hue, Charlotte felt something she had never experienced: acceptance. She closed her eyes, opening herself to the serenity of death when—a shriek, shrill and vicious pierced her ears. Victor spasmed and flailed from her chest, a cloud of fog encompassing him. Before she could react, he spilled from her in a bloody puddle, landing on the snow and running.<br><br>Pulling herself from the edge of death, she gave chase. Calling his name, she ran through the forest until her legs could hardly carry her, until finally, within her view, was Victor, sitting at the edge of a thick fog. His face, twisted and feral, screamed as a dark hooded figure emerged from the fog, grabbed his arm, and seized him. The serenity that had crept into Charlotte was extinguished, replaced with the seething hatred and rage she had depended on for so long. With a tight grip on her sickle, she charged into the fog, prepared to eviscerate any who set foot near her brother.",

Amidst the prestige, he had only one desire: more. Even as a child he found ways to draw crowds. Working at his family’s restaurant, he attracted business with spectacles he performed using throwing knives. Gullible tourists believed this was a traditional South Korean experience, gladly parting with their money to witness it. Ji-Woon's father spent the restaurant’s earnings on dancing and vocal lessons for his son, pushing him to attain the fame he never could.<br><br>Ji-Woon did not disappoint. After years showcasing his abilities to nobodies at talent shows, he hit the track to stardom. Yun-Jin Lee, a producer at Mightee One Entertainment, recruited Ji-Woon into her training program. He transferred to a dormitory in Seoul where, for fourteen hours a day, he was crafted into a star, taught how to move and sing, how to carry himself with the right balance of confidence and modesty.<br><br>Draining as the process was, it worked. Yun-Jin selected Ji-Woon to join the band NO SPIN, bringing a raw energy to their tracks. Fame was almost immediate. Ji-Woon lived in a daze of interviews and adoration, and though the frenzied schedule exhausted his bandmates, he was invigorated. Each day was an affirmation that he was greater than the mediocrity society spewed out.<br><br>But over time, the champagne grew stale. When he looked at his fans, he saw their joy and envy split five ways, thinned out between each band member. The validation that had surged through him left a desperate yearning for more.<br><br>Ji-Woon kept up impressions, mimicking a charm long buried under loathing. He recorded the latest NO SPIN album with his bandmates, never missing a beat. After a lengthy lunch break, he returned to the studio to discover fate had granted him a gift. The scent of burning wires was unmistakable. He rushed to the control room, finding the door blocked by fallen speakers. On the other side, his bandmates pounded on the door, their cries accompanied by the crackling of flames.<br><br>Ji-Woon called to them, dashing to the speakers, grabbing one and—stopping. He froze. Each breath was a conscious, deliberate process requiring all his attention, the nearby cries hardly audible until, slowly, he backed away. And then he heard it. They were screaming his name as they burnt. Screaming for him to save them. Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon Hak! It was the most beautiful thing he’d ever heard. When the fire crew arrived, his tears were genuine.<br><br>Ji-Woon was celebrated as a tragic figure, a hero who did all he could in a futile attempt to save his friends. Yun-Jin paraded him through interviews until it was time to rebrand. He was reborn as The Trickster, a solo artist who produced his own songs, sporting a soft heart beneath a wild exterior. But, away from concert set-ups and television stages, something darker grew.<br><br>He targeted those who lived alone, coming to them in the night. The first was a college music student with a captivating voice. Ji-Woon woke him with a baseball bat to the skull, binding his arms and legs, gagging him with a rag duct taped into his mouth. He tortured him for hours, dissecting him alive. Yet there was something missing—a sound, a connection. He wanted to hear the victim’s wonderous voice pleading as he cut his belly open, but all he received was muffled cries through a rag.<br><br>He learned and adjusted.<br><br>Victims had to be abducted, driven to an abandoned building where he could let their voices carry unrestrained emotion. He made music from them, prodding in the right places to evoke different types of shrieks and howls. Stabbing the quadratus lumborum elicited a long, guttural wail, while slashing the carotid artery created a sound similar to a cat being strangled. There was honesty in their suffering. Ji-Woon recorded each session, synthesizing and working them into his songs, hiding them behind layers of melodies.<br><br>He was elated with his work. He left hints for police, arranging a mink boa from a recent photoshoot around a victim’s slashed throat. For his next killing, he removed the teeth from a man that a boxer in one of his music videos was without. During a particularly audacious plea for attention, he killed a fan he had met during a VIP meet-up, replacing her eyes with his diamond cufflinks and writing I HAVE SEEN GOD in blood across her chest. Each scene was a dazzling spectacle.<br><br>Between music and murder, Ji-Woon’s work was discussed globally. However, as violence became his preferred art style, his music career took a hit. Revenue was down and Mightee One executives pointed their fingers at him. Yun-Jin, with professional fury, came to his defense, but she was outnumbered. It was decided that Ji-Woon could no longer self-produce his songs.<br><br>The decision was devastating. His tracks fused genuine humanity into music, yet executives rejected anything that wasn’t generic and expected. And so be it. If they couldn’t understand his art, he would incorporate them into it until they did. \n\nHe had three months until he was to perform a private show for Mightee One’s board members; three months to plan his magnum opus. He transferred obscene amounts of money to a veterinarian in exchange for cannisters of nitrous oxide, then bribed the stage technician of Mightee One’s private theatre for access to the room. His celebrity granted him a benefit of the doubt no regular person could conceive. When the show was ready, gas seeped into the room as executives and stagehands awaited Ji-Woon, conveniently running behind schedule. \n\nWhen he arrived, half-conscious bodies were splayed in their seats and crawling across the floor. He worked quickly, binding everyone, pausing only when he came to Yun-Jin—the woman who had plucked him from a mudhole and set him on the path he deserved. She would be rewarded, granted special access to the coming display of wonder. Even under sedation, she fought, a raging storm within her, far stronger than the others. He propped her up as the lone audience member, prying her eyes open. The others, sniveling and sobbing, were brought on stage to perform their final act. With a contemptable sneer, he slapped makeup onto their faces and shone stage lights upon them. They became his instruments. \n\nTo the sound of self-produced melodies, he tortured them, gracefully dashing from one body to another, conducting an operatic crescendo from their wailings. They shouted, whimpered, screamed, cried for their loved ones, cried for their mothers. It was a magnificent outpouring of emotion, of what it meant to be human, and they did it with eyes fixed on Ji-Woon. \n\nViscera drained from the stage until, with the toss of his throwing knife, the final human instrument fell silent and the music stopped. Covered in sweat and blood, an exhausted Ji-Woon looked to Yun-Jin and bowed. Curtain call. He had attained perfection. With blade in hand, he made his way to Yun-Jin, prepared to tie up loose ends before the credits rolled. But as he reached her— \n\nThe Fog. \n\nFrom where, he didn’t know, but it billowed around them, damp, cool... comfortable. He saw the grand stage: hospitals and temples, forests and slaughterhouses—an eternal plane adorned with rusted hooks, sustained by the million eyes that would watch him, run from him, <i>experience him</i>. All he had to do was accept, become an implement of The Fog and, most importantly, make them scream. \n\nEncore!",

Some said, frolic in brine, goblins be thine--if you keep playing in the water, the monster will come for you. <br><br>Nine months later, Sadako was born. As a child, her immense powers seemed impossible to control and flared in anger. This became apparent when she was unable to control her rage during a public demonstration of her mother’s powers. When a journalist called her mother a fraud, Sadako’s powers surged, and the journalist collapsed on the floor, struck dead. <br><br>Then everything went wrong. Her mother passed away and shortly after Sadako was lured to an old, crumbling well. As she leaned over the rim, a long shadow fell over her. She turned and a sudden jolt of pain hit her over the head, cracking it open. Her vision dimmed and her mind swirled into unconsciousness. She felt two hands pushing her over the rim. <br><br>Pain exploded in her skull as she hit the cold ground. A grinding noise came from above and the well darkened, all light obscured like a midday eclipse. <br><br>Every inch of her body screamed in pain. Looking up, she saw the only way out. She dug her nails into the muddy ground and slowly crawled toward the cobbled wall. She gripped the stones to climb but had neither hold nor strength. Each time she clawed up a few inches, her nails slid against the wet wall and she slipped down. Her fingers gushed with blood as the coarse cobblestone tore off her nails and lacerated the flesh underneath. And yet she tried, again and again. <br><br>Decades later, the meadow became a resort, and a log cabin was built above the well. When a visitor rented the cabin, Sadako found an opportunity for revenge. She summoned all her nensha power and projected a terrible curse on a videotape that killed its viewer after seven days. <br><br>Her wrath was like the tides of a stormy sea, violent and unforgiving. As she plunged into a fury, a dark fog coiled at her feet. The sound of crashing waves echoed through the old stone well. <br><br>Suddenly, a tidal surge came crashing down on the cabin's walls, wrecking its logs into a torrent of mud and filth.

Their goal was to establish a peaceful society free of dark thoughts and emotions, attracting the dismayed, disenchanted, and disillusioned from all over the country.<br><br>This peace-loving community thrived over the years, and members freely followed the dictates of its charismatic leader Otto Stamper who taught his followers the secret of maintaining happiness through joy-talk, meditation, and the endless reciting of ‘good-thinking’ mantras.<br><br>But not all was bliss within The Fold, and Otto swiftly banished anyone who confessed to having dark thoughts or speaking dark words. Those he appointed as guardians of The Fold were quick to root out malcontents, banishing anyone who thought or spoke against the almost perfect community he had established.<br><br>In this way, Otto had conditioned Ottomarians to believe dark thoughts were the root of all discontent. He spoke of an ancient god called, Druanee, telling them how this god fed on dark memories and desires and how they needed to expel any and all manifestations of darkness from their hearts for fear of summoning this horror from the Land of Shadows.<br><br>Life was more or less a Utopian dream on the island until, that is, the darkness began to slowly leak through the cracks of their spiritual dam and members began to mysteriously disappear.<br><br>It wasn’t long before fear closed its septic jaws on the island and refused to let go.<br><br>The once happy community now gathered in a few homes chanting all the ‘good-thinking’ mantras in a desperate attempt to rid their lives of this formless creature that seemed to stalk them in the shadows and consume them in their sleep.<br><br>Otto tried to quell his followers, telling them that there were malcontents among their ranks and that they alone had summoned the Druanee to their Garden of Joy.<br><br>As The Fold bleated fear, Otto evoked desperate measures. Ottomarians were restricted to their homes to prevent the spread of rumors and dark-talk while sleep was forbidden to prevent anyone from releasing dark dreams into the world. Freedom and sleep would return just as soon as the Druanee was no longer upon them.<br><br>But when Ottomarians continued to disappear, Otto assembled his followers near the beach where he placed a screaming woman on a wooden stage. There, in the rain, Otto explained to his drenched, alienated, and sleep-deprived congregation that the woman was a journalist here to destroy everything they had created.<br><br>As the guardians held the trembling woman, she screamed that Otto wasn’t the savior he claimed to be. He belonged to an ancient cult, an exclusive club of billionaires that took pleasure in corrupting and sacrificing people, towns and even countries to an Elder God. The journalist told them Otto hadn't banished anyone! He had tortured and sacrificed them and that they would all be next.<br><br>Without hesitation, Otto slit her throat before she could continue to spread lies. As she collapsed to her knees with her hands clasped around her neck, he told his confused and terrified herd that she was working with others within their ranks and that they needed to find the impostors before the Druanee came for them all.<br><br>Otto’s words shot over the congregation and reached into the murky recesses of their hearts and dredged up dark and fearful things.<br><br>Years of suppressed emotions began to bubble up as a thick fog pushed through restless legs and feet. Whispers began, and the whispers became panicked mantras, and the mantras became screams and curses as each member accused the next of malthinking and malspeaking.<br><br>Over the howling wind and pounding rain, the screams and curses grew louder and louder as everyone desperately tried to contain the darkness within. But the harder they tried, the quicker they failed, and within moments the dam burst to release a torrent of hell.<br><br>Otto watched his once blissful and joyful herd suddenly erupt into violence unlike anything he had ever seen before. The Fold bleated accusations and tore each other to bits and pieces with hands and teeth and never once did they look up to see their kind and charismatic shepherd smiling down upon them with eyes that were cold, bleak and without pity.<br><br>When it was all over, Otto felt the creaking, wooden stage shake as a murder of crows circled above. Suddenly, the ground rose and then sank into a thick, oozing black mud like molasses. Moments later, a formless mass squelched out of the muck and rose like a rearing horse to feed upon the writhing mass of butchered humanity.<br><br>It was everywhere and nowhere at once as it slowly picked its way through the carnage, absorbing the darkness, savoring the misery, trailing terrible noises. Shrieks. Cries. Whimpers. Pops.

    "BAE53DDC49FD307E47E843800889BA03": "Tarhos Kovács didn’t remember much about his childhood, but what he did remember he would chase his entire life. He remembered the cries and screams in the village. He remembered his mother forcing him to swallow a thick, black fluid like medicine. He remembered collapsing to the hard floor only to awaken in a mass grave, buried under a crush of bodies, with the sound of the village burning in his ears. He remembered pushing, pulling, and climbing to the top of the bloody mass only to be seized by the death, destruction, and silence—the indifferent and impenetrable silence. A high-pitched whine suddenly sounded in his ears and his skin began to prickle as he realized he was in the presence of something he couldn’t possibly understand. And though he couldn’t articulate what he was experiencing, he knew it wasn’t pain, grief, or fear. It was something else. Something closer to—<br><br>Awe. <br><br>As Tarhos tried to make sense of the moment, he didn’t notice the men who approached him from behind. He didn’t even react when they carried him off to a horse-drawn buggy and locked him up in a small, wooden cage with other slaves. He just stared at the scene, mesmerized. And even as they rode away telling him he was headed for Italy, Tarhos stared through the wooden cracks with eyes wide open and a heart wanting to understand what could not be understood. <br><br>From that day on, Tarhos belonged to the Guardia Compagnia where he trained under Kadir Hakam. There he learned to wield weapons, forge armor, and recite a code of chivalry to obediently serve those who would employ his services. As the years passed, Tarhos made few friends amongst the hostile and competitive mercenaries. But his skill, strength, and smarts attracted a small following who believed his courage brought them luck in battle and that one day he would help them earn their collective freedom. Three of his followers pledged their undying allegiance to Tarhos and came to be known as his faithful three. His pack. <br><br>Alejandro Santiago apprenticed with the Guardia Compagnia’s armorer. <br><br>Durkos Malecek showed an aptitude for stealth and silent kills. <br><br>Sander Rault matched Tarhos in size and strength. His weapon of choice: a massive battle axe. <br><br>As the Guardia Compagnia carried out campaigns in faraway lands, Tarhos dispatched countless enemies. Years passed. Blood flowed. And yet, all that killing still didn’t bring Tarhos closer to what he had experienced in his village. Nevertheless, for his bravery in battle, Tarhos was granted knighthood and freedom. The Hungarian slave was now liberated, his brutality rewarded, though his heart still longed for something else—something he could not name or describe. Tired of taking orders from those he considered his inferiors, Tarhos left the Guardia Compagnia to strike out on his own. Their leader, however, refused to release his followers. <br><br>Determined to raise enough gold to liberate his followers, Tarhos found employment with a wealthy Italian Lord. Vittorio Toscano was the Duke of Portoscuro. He was also a scholar, a world traveler, and a collector of ancient knowledge that had been hidden by an unknown cabal of mystics. Tarhos joined Vittorio’s latest expedition to find a fragment of a pillar from an ancient school lost to time. A stone Vittorio called the Lapis Paradisus for he believed it held secrets to open a gateway into a perfect world beyond good and evil. <br><br>The expedition searched Roman ruins in France and crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into Spain where the path led to the catacombs beneath the Portuguese city of Sintra. <br><br>The citizens there considered the catacombs sacred. Tarhos would have to kill the villagers guarding the entrance to retrieve the stone. Not wanting to shed blood, Vittorio commanded Tarhos to find another way. But Tarhos—who had seen the most horrific acts committed under the guise of chivalry—refused to be dissuaded by pretenses of honor. He waited for Vittorio to ride back to camp. Then, with a mighty roar, he pushed forward, cutting a path of blood and gore into the darkness until he had the stone in his grasp. <br><br>Upon returning to the town of Portoscuro, Tarhos imprisoned Vittorio in his own dungeon, demanding to know the meaning behind the symbols etched in the stone. When Vittorio refused to talk, Tarhos brutally tortured his friends and relatives and made horrific displays of their bodies in the streets. But nothing he did shook Vittorio’s resolve to keep the secrets of the stone from Tarhos. Enraged, Tarhos seized control of Vittorio’s riches and raised a small army. Within months, Tarhos fearlessly marched upon the Guardia Compagnia, decimating their barracks, freeing his followers, cutting down his enemies like twigs and collecting their ‘righteous’ heads for his growing displays of ‘valor.’ <br><br>In time several lords in neighboring provinces believed Tarhos was the very embodiment of evil. They banded together to create a ‘moral’ and ‘virtuous’ army to purge evil from Portoscuro. Tarhos ignored their threats. He viewed the lords as a cowardly lot who cloaked their greed and ambition in laws, codes, and platitudes. Laws and codes and platitudes designed to hide from the very darkness Tarhos embraced and accepted without judgment. <br><br>But, with his enemies on the march, Tarhos headed toward the dungeons to give Vittorio the death he deserved. He refused to afford him even the slightest hope of rescue. With dark intentions, he entered the small prison, wound his way into the bowels of the earth, and pushed through a torch-lit corridor. He hesitated for a moment, realizing he would never learn Vittorio’s knowledge and secrets. But neither would anyone else. That was good enough for him. And so, he unlocked and kicked open the dungeon door. Two quick strides brought him to an empty, rat-infested chamber. <br><br>Tarhos stood silent for a moment, then a roar of indignation burst out of his lungs as the sounds of battle suddenly reverberated through the town. Instantly, he stumbled through the corridor, rushed up the twisting stairs, vaulted out of the moonlit doorway and charged through pools of gleaming blood and viscera, smashing and shattering his way through the enemy. The ‘moral’ and ‘virtuous’ lords rained flaming boulders and tree-trunks among the town, bursting through homes, crushing villagers like worms, pounding the ground and igniting stacks of hay and piles of lumber into massive tongues of fire. <br><br>Amidst the carnage and chaos, the pack found Tarhos, and back-to-back, they became a whirlwind of death. Some believed their courage gave them luck. Others believed something otherworldly protected them. Whatever it was, they alone felled dozens of warriors as easily as stomping and crushing beetles. And as they butchered the enemy, Tarhos didn’t notice the strange fog rising from the fallen corpses and clattering armor until he couldn’t see two inches in front of him in any direction. <br><br>Tarhos stumbled forward, groping in the thick fog like the dark fluid his mother forced down his throat all those years ago. His coordination and sense of direction was confused as he called out for his pack. How long he stumbled in the almost perfect darkness he did not know. But suddenly the fog dissipated to reveal a fantasmal wasteland of rotting bodies and burning villages and great crumbling towers leaning drunkenly on the horizon. He stared in awe. A familiar high-pitched whine sounded in his ears and his skin began to prickle. He stood transfixed, realizing by some incredible chance, his heart had found exactly what it had been searching for all his life. He didn’t need Vittorio. He didn’t need the stone. He had found his paradise. He had found—<br><br>The beauty and the horror. <br><br>He had found—<br><br>The Sublime.",

He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him. <br><br>As he watched the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.<br><br>As his world collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.<br><br>Then another feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting, like the fear he’d felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.<br><br>He was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively knew what he had to do. He couldn’t fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be screaming, but he could make the world quiet again. Until the only sound remaining was the blessed howl of the saw.<br><br>Let the outsiders come.",

But that plan was shattered on the night that a junkie broke into his wife’s clinic, hoping to score. <br><br>After this event resulted in the death of his unborn son, John finally caught up with the junkie, making him his first test subject, and the Pig was changed forever too. It became a representation of the disease that was rotting John from the inside, a reminder that we are just meat unless we elevate ourselves through our actions, by grasping life from the jaws of death.<br><br>The Pig became a vessel, an agent of Jigsaw, conveying the subjects to their test. For some of those who emerged victorious, the Pig could still be a rebirth, into their new lives as apprentices, even disciples, of Jigsaw. <br><br>That was the case for Amanda Young, a troubled soul, whose life had been a catalogue of harm, both to herself and those around her. That changed when she faced, and bested, Jigsaw’s test. Deciding her life was worth something, she became devoted to Jigsaw’s cause, ready to take over when the cancer consumed him.<br><br>But she became more dependent on John, her anguish at his impending death combining with a belief that their test subjects weren’t capable of saving themselves, of being reborn in the crucible of the games. <br><br>Seeing this, John presented her with another game, another chance to save herself, but Amanda let her rage and jealousy rule her actions. She failed the test and took a bullet as a consequence. <br><br>Bleeding out on the tiled floor, darkness engulfed Amanda’s vision, accompanied by a sound like creaking wood. Then she was in a forest, once more viewing the world through the eyes of a Pig. Trees surrounded her, their branches clawing at her from all sides. Waves of panic washed over her and she could hear her breath reverberating inside the mask.<br><br>Had she been damned, cursed to spend her days here, in this guise? Or maybe this was another test? Maybe she hadn’t failed at all? John always thought one step ahead of everyone else, planned for every eventuality, and he would never give up on her, surely?<br><br>Jigsaw may have gone but he had passed her onto another. A being for whom she would be The Pig again.<br><br>Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined for slaughter. ",

As the boy grew, so did his father’s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.<br><br>Academically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.<br><br>On his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers’ barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.<br><br>After a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as ‘fake’.<br><br>By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.<br><br>In early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth’s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man’s finger.<br><br>Returning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.<br><br>After a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes. He assumed a new name: Jeffrey Hawk.<br><br>Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit community, “Jeffrey” had to learn to socialize. He donned a new personality like a disguise, quickly becoming known as charming and helpful, and was welcomed into his new family.<br><br>Over the next decade, he stayed with the circus, traveling the length and breadth of the USA. But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.<br><br>Once their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he found the best, he would cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection, disposing of the rest of the body as pointless waste.<br><br>Men, women, young, old, he didn’t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety, in the memories and stories they evoke.<br><br>He removed the costume less and less, shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true self.<br><br>With time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim managed to work free of her bindings while he was sleeping off the drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he awoke to find the rest of the circus bearing down on him. He whipped his horse and the caravan disappeared into the night.<br><br>Since then he has roamed the country, a parasite who could always be found at a carnival or circus, but who would never been seen on any playbill. He lured those brave, or foolish, enough to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be found missing.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, he left the ordinary roads of the USA behind him, traveling through a veil of mist and entering a new realm. It was a place of transience and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life he had chosen to lead. Feeling more at home than he had in his entire life, he set up camp and waited for his first visitor.",

    "8906517F4A132A5B371DB69004A72D06": "Carmina Mora was a gifted artist who carried the guilt of her young brother's death. Growing up a rugged coastal village in southern Chile, she sketched the sublime landscapes of Patagonia. Sitting outside, she painted dramatic fjords while feeding the crows nested in the tree next to the house. <br><br>She grew up carrying the guilt of her mother's sudden departure. Her father blamed Carmina for her mother's abandonment, which added to her grief. She became the caretaker of Matias, her little brother, despite still being a child herself. <br><br>A year later, Carmina was painting with Matias outside when the telephone rang. Her father remained in the yard, drinking his beer. Carmina rushed to the house to answer the phone and hung up a few seconds later. When she returned outside, Matias was nowhere to be seen. She asked her father, but he had paid no attention to Matias. She called her brother's name, looking for him everywhere. While searching, she saw a bright red coat floating on the narrow creek by the house--Matias' jacket. She jumped into the creek and found him floating on the surface with vacant eyes, unblinking. He had fallen and drowned. <br><br>Her scream tore the sky. Her father found Carmina sobbing on the creek's shore, clutching her brother's body in her arms, surrounded by a murder of crows. Her father snatched Matias's body away from her, and she cried until her voice broke. <br><br>The following morning, the world was cloaked in darkness. Her father did not say a word, because he did not have to. Carmina knew it was all her fault. Months passed, yet her loss was as fresh as morning dew. Crippled with self-loathing, she could no longer paint. Without Matias, life had no meaning. <br><br>On the bleak morning of Matias’s birthday, Carmina walked to a narrow bridge several blocks away from home. She was convinced that nothing could bring her relief. Her mother was gone, her brother was dead, and her father blamed her for it all. She was convinced that she had nothing left to live for. <br><br>Carmina walked to the railing of the bridge that stood over the turbulent river. Locals had nicknamed the spot DeathLeap. Several cars drove by Carmina, but none stopped. No one seemed to care. She climbed over the railing and her legs wobbled as she stood on the lip of the bridge. She looked down, watching the fierce river smash into a giant boulder. She closed her eyes.<i>See you soon, Matias.</i> <br><br>Suddenly, a cacophony of caws filled the sky. Carmina opened her eyes and saw a black cloud of feathers flying toward her. The cloud split open and glossy black crows dove from the sky. One landed on her shoulder and stared intently into Carmina’s eyes, as if peering into her soul. Her grip on the railing loosened and the crow cawed raucously. Carmina stared at the crow, confused. <br><br>Another crow landed on the railing, then another. Soon, a flock of crows were covering the railing of the bridge, staying close to her. She felt their heavy stare on her, calculative and enigmatic, as if they were assessing her. She looked down for a second and a thunder of caws interrupted her dark impulse.  The crows seemed to care about her wellbeing. As she dangled over the edge with the wind blowing through her raven hair, Carmina felt akin to them. For the first time since Matias had died, Carmina did not feel alone. <br><br>She returned home, giving life another chance. The crows left but Carmina suspected that if anything happened to her, they would return. <br><br>Inspired by her ordeal, Carmina picked up a brush. In the weeks that followed, she painted her experience, using black ink to depict the DeathLeap with a black cloud of feathers, the murder of crows that saved her life. The experience was transformative and launched her signature, black-ink surrealist art. <br><br>After several years, some color pierced the darkness, and this shift of medium expanded her art form. She painted large-scale murals on busy street corners, designed grandiose costumes, and recited militant poetry. Carmina’s art displayed local, intimate tragedies on a large scale, making them impossible to ignore. And everywhere she performed, crows followed. <br><br>Her performances grew bold and drew the attention of artists who found her style invigorating. She grew close to a group of painters who understood her iconoclastic vision. Her performances launched the Large-Scale Surrealist movement, which became a phenomenon. <br><br>Her renown grew enough to attract the commission of a multinational enterprise, The Vack Label. Carmina investigated the group, discovering that they gifted art pieces to select disreputable congressmen. Vack’s commissioned artists seemed to disappear afterward. <br><br>Determined to expose the group's link to corrupt politics, Carmina accepted Vack's commission. The following week, Carmina painted a giant mural on a cemetery's columbarium, displaying the Vack Label logo as a surrealist grim reaper harvesting the fields of Chilean families. She wore a theatrical dress as she painted, on which she had stitched a poem about political revolution. <br><br>The piece sparked a radical debate about corruption. The controversy painted a target on Carmina's back. After receiving anonymous death threats, she took refuge in her father’s house, bringing along her closest friends for safety. <br><br>That night, a gang of masked gunmen broke into the house. They swiftly subdued Carmina and her friends, threw them in a van, and drove off. <br><br>The following morning, a dry breeze blew sand on Carmina's face, awakening her. She was seated in a chair in the middle of the desert, with her legs tied and her hands handcuffed. Her friends were lying on the ground, tied up. A shadow fell over her face. Carmina looked up. <br><br> A man dressed in a long robe with his face hidden in a dark hood approached her. He pulled a silvery knife from his robe. <br><br>He grabbed her hands and recited a hymn in an unfamiliar language. Carmina held his gaze. He paused and brought down his blade with a sudden blow. <br><br> She cried in agony as her friends woke to a terrible sight; Carmina's severed hands falling in the sand.The handcuffs followed, landing into a pool of blood <br><br>The hooded man smiled in satisfaction. <i>How are you going to paint now? </i>Carmina cursed and screamed at him, wriggling against the bonds on her legs. <br><br> The man grabbed Carmina’s chin. She spit in his face. <br><br>He grunted and pried her mouth open, pulling out her tongue. Carmina struggled against his hold. In a violent blow, he chopped off Carmina's tongue. <br><br>She howled in anguish. The man wiped his blade on his robe, leaving a trail of blood. <i> How are you going to recite poems now? </i> <br><br> Sorrow swelled in Carmina's chest, sharper than pain. Overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage, grief and loss overcame her senses. She had lost her little brother. And she had lost the only way to cope with such pain. Carmina screamed like on the day her brother died. <br><br>Raucous caws echoed through the wasteland. The sky was obscured by a cyclone of dark clouds. Black feathers fell on Carmina's bleeding arms. She looked up and saw a torrent of crows erupting from the clouds, diving on the hooded man. <br><br>As the ravenous crows pecked at his flesh mercilessly, Carmina smiled, watching her Surrealist art coming to life. <br><br>But her heart lurched with rage when she saw the crows move on to their next target, her friends on the ground. She screamed as waves of pain, guilt, and fright overwhelmed her. But it was in vain, the ravenous crows were uncontrollable. <br><br>Darkness fell over her eyes as her friends' agonizing screams grew more acute. Death was coming and again, it was her fault. <br><br>A deep, black fog engulfed her. ",

He’d stopped attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he’d been taken away from Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he’d lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they’d kept moving him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption center. They’d been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they’d spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar.<br><br>Ormond was a small, stale place; a remote town of six thousand inhabitants where gray winters drag on for most of the year. Frank did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his mind when he caught the attention of a beautiful girl. Julie was a popular girl who was convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie’s best friend.<br><br>They would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joey to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner’s back.<br><br>As the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn’t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they’d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man’s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man’s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joey’s car and drove up Mount Ormond.<br><br>All four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness. Julie, Susie, and Joey finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joey did not return home that night, their parents thought they’d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.",

It was one of those muggy afternoons in Florida when heat and humidity permeated everything in the kitchen, making him sweat while standing still. He slouched in a damp chair to read. This article had better be good—his work in Roseville had been outstanding.<br><br><i><b>GHOST FACE DISAPPEARS</b></i><br><br>June 18, 1993<br><br>At first glance, Jed Olsen was a modest and enthusiastic freelancer with experience in a variety of small newspapers. The staff at the Roseville Gazette appreciated how easy-going and honest he seemed, and so he was treated as a stranger for no more than five minutes into his interview:<br><br>“Jed quickly spotted the editor-in-chief in the room, gave him a wide smile and a firm handshake, and talked about good old American values. And that was it, he was in.”—Ex-Contributor at the Roseville Gazette<br><br>Olsen never justified his erratic career path, which zigzagged between several small towns from Utah to Pennsylvania. There was no verification of his previous jobs. He had a decent portfolio plus a good attitude, and they needed a contributor right away.<br><br><b>THE ROSEVILLE MURDERS</b><br><br>Olsen had been working at the newspaper for five months when the Roseville Murders began: victims from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.<br><br>The murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he’d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.<br><br>The whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story. Olsen was often sent to interview the family of victims and relay official statements from the police. Unknown to everyone at the time, his involvement added to the final body count.<br><br><b>THE GHOST FACE</b><br><br>Panic swelled in Roseville when Olsen produced footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. The masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. “Ghost Face Caught on Tape” was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.<br><br>Weeks later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:<br><br>“I hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don’t worry, I'm not done.” –Jed Olsen<br><br>The Roseville law enforcement still refuses to comment as Jed Olsen remains at large. <br><br>Danny smiled, ripping out the article from the newspaper. When the investigation had been pointing to him, he’d packed his bags and left Roseville swiftly.<br><br>He got up, the clammy seat pulling his skin. An oppressive humidity engulfed him as he entered the bedroom. Condensation dribbled on a small misted-up window as bits of cracked wallpaper hung limply. Its floral pattern was covered with gruesome photos and newspaper headlines. Danny pinned the week-old article on top of a picture of lacerated scalps. A faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after following that girl down the street? He couldn’t remember clearly.<br><br>Taking a step back, he admired his work on the wall. His mind drifted, remembering all the articles he’d written, the stories he’d planned, and the scenes he’d brought to life.<br><br>A shiver ran through him. A chilling breeze transformed the bedroom's humidity into an opaque, freezing Fog. A woman shrieked. Dead leaves crunched under his feet.<br><br>He smiled in anticipation.",

Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever. She worked herself to the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on new ones, as she aided the priests during purification rituals.<br><br>The priests were more and more in need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague had resurfaced. Within months, the priests contracted the disease. It did not take long before they became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The swelling panic had to be contained, even if by a novice.<br><br>Anxious before her first ceremony, Adiris visited the priests’s sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.<br><br>The great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the followers, who were struck already by her youth and beauty.<br><br>As she began reciting the epic of creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody part to the gods, asking them to protect the woman.  A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.<br><br>Tales of her wealth, beauty, and devotion began to spread across the city as quickly as the disease.  Soon, Adiris’s followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.<br><br>But her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood, her neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her followers.<br><br>But no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to appease the gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled north with a few followers, venturing through the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer possible to walk.<br><br>They camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she could not go any further. Her followers and she realized the truth in that cave: they were all infected with the plague.<br><br>Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before being wiped off by a cold breeze.<br><br>Neither the body of Adiris nor her followers were ever found. Many told tales of her return, but no one truly knew what fate had befallen the High Priestess of Babylon.",

Hiding behind a mask of warmth and friendliness, Freddy's actual temperament was known only to his victims.

They thought fire had rid them of a monster that night, that their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving.<br><br>Years passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.<br><br>Freddy focused his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession: Nancy Holbrook. But he underestimated her strength and resourcefulness. Together with her friend, Quentin, she managed to weaken Freddy, mutilating him and leaving him for dead once more.<br><br>Death didn't want Freddy the first time he encountered it, why did they think it would take him now? He emerged once more, consumed with vengeance. Then he turned his sights on the boy who had blocked his path to Nancy, his number one. <br><br>Freddy invaded Quentin's dreams, terrorizing him night after night, until his strength and defenses would be at their lowest. When the time was right, he forced the boy to return to the dark reflection of Badham Preschool. Here he would have his final revenge.<br><br>Freddy stalked the boy through the school's halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt. This was what he enjoyed the most: the smell of their sweat in the air, the ragged gasps of their terrified breath. They were his to play with. <br><br>There was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore? Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall. Their tips traced along a pipe, the metallic shrieking only adding to the boy’s apprehension.<br><br>A shower of sparks rained on the ground, and into the liquid that covered the tiled floor. A blue flame blossomed and quickly engulfed the room.<br><br>The boy took flight as Freddy burst from the flames in a fury. Rooms and walls raced past in a blur until they were in Freddy's basement.

She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family’s shaky finances. Her mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.<br><br>Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That’s when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin’s father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.<br><br>His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin’s father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.<br><br>That evening, Rin came home from work. She’d stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother’s scream from the house.<br><br>She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents’ room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.<br><br>A sharp katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the katana with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm again.<br><br>She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the doorframe as support, she raised herself up. The katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met by her father’s blade.<br><br>She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother’s tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.<br><br>Rin charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she reclined in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.<br><br>As she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.<br><br>She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he’d done to her—with what he’d done to her mother.<br><br>Coughing up blood, her chin grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched heartbeat started to ring in her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could no longer move.<br><br>The ground shook with her father’s footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.<br><br>A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest—not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.<br><br>An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.",

    "660A159946FAC710560FAB9F0D80C196": "Honoring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father’s reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai.  His father tried to turn Kazan’s attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father’s katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him ‘Oni-Yamaoka,’ the rageful samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.<br><br>Determined to redeem his family’s name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of imposters. How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he had taken a kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it?  Or had it been because of his need to secure a ‘trophy’ from his victims. It didn’t matter. Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.<br><br>As Kazan made for the lord’s town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai’s head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father’s face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again… his father was gone. Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.<br><br>Bitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father’s voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as ‘Oni-Yamaoka.’<br><br>With renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord’s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.<br><br>Satisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing the ‘Oni’ who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left him to die a slow, agonizing death. When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black fog and Kazan’s body and the kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town.",

    "B6DC8CB747C056247547FA81C184ED3A": "Born in the dust-ridden badlands of the American Midwest, Caleb Quinn was son to struggling Irish immigrants. On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine, and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb's father, once an engineer, had few options to ply his trade as businesses posted a common sign: No Irish Need Apply. His antiquated tools laid untouched for years until Caleb uncovered them. Noticing his son’s interest in the trade, he gifted him his old wrench.<br><br>The devices Caleb made under his father’s guidance had quaint applications, but when his father was away, they took a grim turn. He hid plans for a mask that would gouge barbed needles into a human’s eyes and rip them from their sockets, complete with sketches of it fitted on boys who bullied him.<br><br>With age, Caleb's engineering abilities became marketable and employers put their discrimination aside. Henry Bayshore, the owner of United West Rail, hired him.<br><br>Caleb first invented a gun that shot railroad spikes into the ground. Next, he made a steam-powered tunneling drill. But as Bayshore feigned indifference, the devices began turning up at other companies, the patents stolen from Caleb and sold.<br><br>A familiar sensation coursed through Caleb's blood, feeding the sharp pain in his heart. Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore’s office and smashed his face into a bloody stew. As he was pulled away, he pushed his specialized gun to his boss’ gut and squeezed the trigger. A railroad spike plowed through skin and viscera, nailing Bayshore to his desk.<br><br>The only thing that saved Caleb from hanging was Bayshore's unlikely survival. For fifteen years, Caleb was confined to Hellshire Penitentiary, the nation’s first private prison. In a fortress of illiterate convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary wealth—political capital—and that his connections could have Bayshore framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: Make him rich. Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.<br><br>Caleb returned to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new—the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry. Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target's abdomen. But as the spear tugged it caught the thief's intestines and, with an ungodly sound, yanked them onto the dusty road. After several iterations the disembowelments dwindled, but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The Deathslinger.<br><br>Looking to protect his asset, the prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates to form Caleb's posse. The Hellshire Gang was born. For six years they roamed the country collecting wanted outlaws for the prison, fulfilling their end of the bargain. After a bloody battle at Glenvale, Caleb caught notice of a newspaper headline: Henry Bayshore Purchases Hellshire Penitentiary. In the picture, a disfigured Bayshore proudly shook the warden’s hand. Caleb's heart pounded with rage, blood swelling as if it would burst from his veins. He’d been sold out, a pawn in a rich man's game.<br><br>The Hellshire Gang pledged their loyalty to Caleb and called for the warden’s head. In a thundering gallop, they smashed through the prison entrance, shrieking like bloodthirsty marauders.  A guard raised his pistol but hesitated. A spear punctured his chest. Caleb grabbed the man's head and slammed it against a prison cell until it spilled through the bars.<br><br>Reaching the warden's office, Caleb kicked the door and was met with a fortunate sight—it wasn’t only the prison warden who cowered in a corner, but Henry Bayshore. Overpowered with rage, Caleb rushed Bayshore, beating, bludgeoning, tearing at his flesh. The man's blood dripped from his face, crimson pooling at his feet. The Hellshire Gang swarmed the warden, snapping bones with each kick.<br><br>With the two men broken and begging for death, the posse dragged them to the commons where they were left to the growing crowd of prisoners.<br><br>Soaked in blood and sweat, Caleb hobbled to his old cell, hardly paying notice to Bayshore’s screams. He sat on the bed’s edge as drops of blood ran from his fingertips. A thick, unnatural fog streamed through the barred window. He pulled out his old wrench, cracked and rusted, and ran a thumb along the metal, regarding it with faded eyes. He couldn’t remember when it came into his possession. He didn’t care to remember. At his feet he saw a dusty path, and, at its end, silhouettes of all who had done him wrong: the boys who bullied him, the executives who took advantage of him, and, again... Henry Bayshore. Emerging from a fog were the tools to dispose of them—unforgiving steel hooks, brilliant and beautiful in their simplicity. Pain tore through his leg as he stood but he endured, pushing onward, walking the dusty path, leaving a trail of blood flowing behind him. ",

As an adult, Yoichi graduated with top honours in marine biology from a university in Tokyo, and, following in his father’s footsteps, became the youngest professor in the school’s history. But his career began to unravel when two of his students disappeared while doing research in Izu Oshima. The mere mention of Izu Oshima triggered painful memories from his past. Deep, hidden memories bubbled up from the murky, black depths of his subconscious. Blurred faces on images, twisted mouths, inexplicable deaths suddenly filled his mind. The shouts of people calling him a monster. And then… the monster… Sadako rose from the abyss to let him know the curse was not over. It would never be over. <br><br>With a cry, Yoichi shut his eyes and slowly released his fear. When he opened his eyes again, Sadako was gone, but something had returned. Something ominous and otherworldly. He could feel an unnerving presence near him, breathing deeply like the heaving sea. Was Sadako tormenting him? Was a spirit trying to warn him? Or was it something else? Something that consumed people. Something that made people disappear. Yoichi wasn’t sure. He had spent his life trying to understand his psychic abilities and the supernatural. His instincts told him the answers somehow lay with water. He had, after all, dedicated his life to studying intelligent life and unexplored realms within the ocean. Perhaps he needed to readjust his definition of intelligent. Or his definition of life. <br><br>Thirsting for truth, Yoichi entered a frenzy of research into the fringes of parapsychology, cryptozoology, theology, folk history. The more he expanded his field of expertise, the more he was ridiculed and ostracized. Once viewed as a brilliant young mind, Yoichi was now considered an eccentric and a liability. In mere months, the university terminated his position. Undeterred, Yoichi sought professorships at other schools, but no reputable college in Japan would take him. As a last resort he approached media outlets, and by some twist of fate, the company where his mother had worked at as a journalist offered to fund his research in exchange for articles and first publishing rights to his story. <br><br>During this difficult time, Yoichi’s father returned to him—his spirit silently goading him to continue the course he had chosen. And so, working around the clock in his tiny Tokyo apartment, he allied himself with other researchers in the paranormal field. Within months, he came across a story that mirrored the disappearances of his students: four vloggers had mysteriously disappeared near a lighthouse in Scotland.  With a great sense of urgency, Yoichi took the first flight he could to Glasgow. A professor at a local university had come to many of the same conclusions as he had nearly seventy years earlier when a film crew disappeared near the very same lighthouse. There was some kind of intelligence in the water—some kind of darkness calling from the sea like an ancient siren. As Yoichi examined the research, his father suddenly appeared to let him know he was on the right path. <br><br>Guided by his father, Yoichi chartered a fishing boat and headed toward a small cluster of islands known as the Seven Hunters. Darkness fell as they approached the isles. The lighthouse, now automated and controlled remotely, sputtered and winked out of existence like a dying star. The ocean began to stir violently, lightning flashed, and the fisherman begged Yoichi to turn back, but Yoichi refused. He was too close and would not be deterred. As they argued the ocean raged and tossed the ship high and low. Then one giant wave lifted the boat as high as a house and dashed it to pieces against dark, jagged rocks. <br><br>Yoichi didn’t remember much after that. He remembered falling into the water. He remembered swimming to the landing where he saw his father standing on the gallery of the lighthouse beckoning him. He remembered staggering through thick black fog as he climbed the stairs. He remembered the water level rising with every step until the frothing mouth of the raging ocean swallowed him whole.",

Her father, Rajan Singh, found remarkable success with a catering business in the small, Quebecoise town. Her house constantly swirled with the wonderful aromas of cumin, chillies, masala, cardamon and fresh, steaming naan pulled from a tandoor oven. Her earliest memories were filled with stories of India and on her tenth birthday her parents promised to visit Punjab just after the new year.<br><br>During the holiday season, her parents went to a party with their closest friends, Marise and Francois Rois. When Haddie called her parents to say she felt sick, they left in a hurry. Driving through the winding, snow-swept roads of rural Quebec, Rajan lost control of the car, skidding into an icy, gnarled forest. It would be two days before their bodies were found trapped in the vehicle. As Haddie’s fever broke, the police arrived at her doorstep telling her that they had not suffered. But Haddie was old enough know to the police were just being kind. The next morning, she woke up with white hair and a question that would haunt her for the rest of her life.<br><br>The Rois took Haddie in, doing their best to fill the hole left by her parents. Despite the enormous loss, Haddie was again surrounded with love: the love her adoptive parents had for their son, Jordan, and the love the three had for her. But the trauma of losing her parents seemed to unlock something within her. She began to see things nobody else could see; horrible, unnatural, unexplainable things. Apparitions tormented her in class, at home, in bed. Her unexpected screams earned her the nickname “Helly Haddie,” only adding to her alienation and anguish. Once a cheerful and social child, Haddie walled herself off to the world.<br><br>With time Haddie realized her uncanny abilities only triggered in certain areas—dark areas. It was as though there were places in the world where another dimension somehow bled into our own.  Jordan called these intersecting areas Overlaps, and they seemed to give Haddie insight into a dark, shadowy world straight out of a cosmic horror story. When Haddie graduated from high school, she felt an unexplainable tug to discover who her parents were. To raise money for a trip to India, her brother Jordan suggested that they use her abilities to explore and document all the haunted places in Quebec, starting with a haunted asylum. At the Dorea Institute, Haddie could see and hear residual memories... patients, doctors, and so much more.<br><br>While recording her impressions at the institute, she offhandedly called the encroaching dimension the Ravage since it not only assaulted her with memories from all times and places but also gave the sense of feeding off psychic energy. The Ravage, she sensed, was a living mosaic of human suffering that was slowly corrupting and devouring the world.  She concluded that they needed to investigate more to see if there was anything to her hypothesis.<br><br>Jordan presented the footage and recordings to their uncle Stefan who helped them turn what they had documented into a web series. Within days of uploading the first episode, Ravages of the Abyss was a viral hit. True crime fans, ghost-chasers, and skeptics flooded the comments with their own theories of what she was experiencing. Stefan handled the production, and before long, he presented Haddie with her first cheque as a professional podcaster.<br><br>Now with a working budget, Haddie was able to investigate the most haunted places in the world seeking answers about the Ravage. Her investigations led her to a secluded island where once an entire town had mysteriously disappeared leaving dozens of empty homes. She never felt such a strong influence of the Ravage as she did here. It pulsed with suffering and cruelty and repressed darkness.<br><br>Haddie absorbed the emotions of the ghost town and closed her eyes. Calming herself and silencing her mind, she began to hear guttural screams and cries and whimpers. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the scintillating orange residual memories of people tearing each other apart in the mud and rain. Then everything disappeared as a much older version of her stepbrother beckoned her from one of the homes.  She chased after him only to stop suddenly with the realization that the Ravage was toying with her emotions, playing tricks on her, making her see things that couldn’t possibly be real.<br><br>The encounter nearly put Haddie off the project entirely, but she was now the linchpin for a company that fed her family. Her uncle Stefan continued to line up sites to visit, and after a personal trip backpacking across India, Haddie carried on subjecting herself to the horrors of the Ravage.<br><br>Then, while investigating a haunted World War II bunker in the Alps, Haddie heard someone faintly crying out for help in Punjabi. Snow flurried in the bunker as a tunnel suddenly opened to a snow-covered forest. A horn blared in the distance and faded away. She saw the glow of red lights through a wall of snow and felt her heart skip a beat as she rushed to a crumpled, blue car pinned between two massive pine trees. Through the shattered windshield she saw the bodies of her parents stuck in pools of frozen blood.<br><br>Haddie narrowed her gaze and saw tiny plumes of vapor floating from their trembling blue lips. With a profound sense of urgency, she rushed around the wreck trying her best to push, pull, and kick her way in. All to no avail. As she cried out to them that she was sorry for being sick, that the accident was all her fault, their eyes snapped open and, in unison, they answered the question that had anchored her life to their death.<br><br><i>Yes... Beti... we suffered...</i><br><br>With a terrible cry Haddie fell back into the snow as ice tendrils wrapped around her and pulled her down into a world of endless darkness.",

    "68555B7044503776F8CDD3B8738D1809": "Born to Alberto and Caterina Toscano in 1343, Vittorio Toscano was the youngest of three and third in line to inherit his family’s land. At age fifteen, his father sent him to train with Ettore Fabrizio, the same knight who trained his older brothers in the military arts. But Vittorio didn’t take to combat training the way his brothers did. As a student of philosophy, he believed physical violence to be the last refuge of the incompetent.<br><br>Infuriated by Vittorio’s pacifism, Fabrizio ordered one of his pages to attack him. Vittorio dodged and blocked the blows, but refused to fight back. When his enraged opponent lunged, Vittorio parried. His attacker tripped, falling on his own dagger. He bled out in less than a minute and Vittorio threw down his sword, swearing never to pick it up again.<br><br>Since Vittorio demonstrated an aptitude for scholarship, his frustrated father sent him to study with his Uncle Renzo. Besides being the Duke of Portoscuro, Renzo was also a scholar and collector of rare artifacts. <br><br>Under Renzo’s tutelage, Vittorio focused his studies on lost civilizations and ancient history. He researched forgotten tomes and became an expert on the philosophy and wisdom of ancient secret societies and obscure guardians of knowledge. Guardians present in almost every century and culture. Guardians that went by manifold names depending on the time and region and were said to be from another dimension—a perfect world. He collected anything on Watchers, Keepers, Guides, Masters, Observers. <br><br>Vittorio’s research revealed these guardians acted as gatekeepers of advanced and arcane knowledge that would gradually help humanity transcend to a higher plane of existence. He theorized the Observers waited for humanity to acquire wisdom before releasing knowledge that otherwise would lead to their self-destruction. Slowly, these Observers found ways to inspire humanity with knowledge that would stimulate growth, understanding and collective wisdom.  <br><br>Vittorio adopted his Uncle Renzo’s view that greed for money and power was the source of all conflict. His hope was that the lost knowledge of these gatekeepers might bring peace, harmony, and order to a violent world.<br><br>At Vittorio’s urging, Renzo mounted an expedition to find lost relics and artifacts from the ruins of antiquity. In Hungary, they discovered a bronze dodecahedron that dated back to Roman times. In Asia minor, they uncovered a hidden tunnel beneath the Obelisk of Theodosius where they discovered stone tablets engraved in Akkadian cuneiform.<br><br> They told the tale of a mysterious artifact split into three and scattered across the world. <br><br>A clue led them to the ruins of Troy where a secret chamber revealed a treasure trove of antiquities. The most precious was a piece of that mysterious artifact. Another clue led them to Isle of Rhodes where a hidden cave held a second part of that same relic. In Delphi, under the Temple of Apollo, Vittorio discovered the third piece on a black marble altar. Engravings on the altar showed a map of Crete and a star over the Palace of Minos. <br><br>Deep in the labyrinth below the ruins of the palace, Vittorio discovered a place to put the key created by the three relics. Ancient machinery came to life. A stone wall slid open, revealing a hidden vault. <br><br>Renzo and Vittorio entered and found a white marble wall inscribed with what seemed to be a form of Sanskrit. The message warned of a cult that sought to corrupt humanity with knowledge it wasn’t ready for. They had hunted down the Observers and imprisoned them. But before being imprisoned, the Observers had hidden artifacts around the world with secret knowledge about this dark force and how to stop it from destroying the world. <br><br>The message on the wall also spoke of a stone from an ancient school that held the secrets of traveling between planes of existence. Vittorio, believing the stone held the key to finding the Observers or their perfect world, called the stone ‘Lapis Paradisus.’ <br><br>As they exited the vault, Renzo stepped on a black serpent. The serpent sank its fangs into Renzo’s leg and disappeared as quickly as it appeared. The venom spread fast and within minutes he passed away. As Renzo’s only heir, Vittorio inherited his estate, his library, his title, and his vast fortune. Determined to honor his uncle and help humanity transcend its weakness, greed, and cruelty, he knew he had to find the Lapis Paradisus and free the Observers if they were still alive.  <br><br>In 1391, Vittorio mounted an expedition. He employed a mercenary knight to aid in the effort and offer protection. Formerly a member of the Guardia Compagnia, Tarhos Kovács feared no man or beast. Vittorio’s explorations and discoveries eventually led them to the heavily guarded catacombs beneath the Portuguese city of Sintra. If the expedition wanted to enter, they would have to kill those who guarded it. Vittorio had no wish to shed blood and told Tarhos to find another way. <br><br>Tarhos defied Vittorio and by the end of the day had him in irons. <br><br>When they returned to Italy, Tarhos locked Vittorio in a dungeon and began a campaign of torture in Portoscuro, promising to stop when he revealed the meaning behind the stone. <br><br>Within weeks, Tarhos grew tired of torturing the townsfolk, and Vittorio was left to rot in the dungeon with no one to talk to but the rats. In his solitude he scratched the symbols from the Lapis Paradisus into the stone floor. He attempted countless sequences while imagining a world like paradise. And just when he was about to surrender to hunger and despair, he tried one last sequence while meditating on a world of endless peace and compassion. <br><br>At first, he thought he had failed. He gasped with the last of his strength as the rats approached menacingly, preparing to feast on his defeated, sallow flesh. Then, suddenly, a cold, unnatural, black fog rose from the stone floor and within moments he heard cries of anguish and crows circling above him. With difficulty he clambered to his feet and found himself in another world—<br><br>Not the paradise he had expected.",

While his close friends orbited the music industry, he followed a surer path. His grades granted him admission to higher education, and there was a demand for teachers abroad.<br><br>After graduating university, he taught extra classes to afford applying fees overseas.

His first plane ride took him to Southern Japan for a new start.<br><br>His life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was little time to do everything he took for granted back home.

Williams uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (the Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of those around him. But his coworkers, Pablo who was raised by a shaman and Kelly who was orphaned by the Deadites, helped him put up a fight. While battling Evil, Ash was reunited with his long-lost daughter Brandy, who encouraged him to embrace his role as savior of humanity. After a terrible fight with a fully formed demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>Ash awakened to a voice, his head throbbing. Since defeating a gang of Deadites a week ago, he had been in a perpetual state of hangover. He heard the voice once more; a woman singing, sensual and inviting.<br><br>Stepping into the corridor in his boxers, he strode toward the voice, which lead to the public locker room. As Ash pushed open the door, the singing stopped. There was a rustling of curtains. He called out, entering the change room. His voice reverberated on the moldy tiled walls. He pressed on, reaching a shower that was still dripping wet. Cold, humid fingers ran down his bare back. He turned around.<br><br>A woman stood naked, her skin glistening in the morning light that streamed in from high windows. Ash recognized her instantly: Linda Emery, one of his former high school flings. They had gotten back together thirty years later, while saving their hometown from Evil. He had ended their relationship soon afterward, preferring to indulge freely in his new-found popularity.<br><br>Linda winked at Ash, who closed the distance between them. He caressed her cheek wistfully: <i>What was she doing here? Did she know anything about the whereabouts of his daughter? And Pablo and Kelly?</i><br><br>A sharp blade dug into his hand, making him jump back. Linda slid a finger across the edge of her blade, collecting Ash’s blood on her fingertip. She smiled, and her skin shriveled, her hair faded, her shoulders stooped, and her curves sagged, aging decades older in a matter of seconds. She attacked Ash, who poorly managed to block, being half-naked.<br><br>Every blow she delivered earned him a new wound. She slashed his bad knee and he fell to the floor. As she jumped on top of him, Ash shrieked in disgust, knocking the knife out of her grasp. Her varicose hands wrapped around his neck, strangling him. Gasping, he outstretched his arm, hand landing on a soap dispenser. He spurted out some liquid on his fingers and poked her in the eyes. The elderly woman winced, weakening her hold, and Ash elbowed her in the face, knocking her back. He rolled over and grabbed the knife on the floor. Just as he was about to plant it in her chest, he stopped. There was something else he wanted more.<br><br>He pressed the blade against her throat. <i>Let’s make a deal, demon. In exchange for not killing you, you portal me back to my friends.</i> The demon agreed.<br><br>She began reciting the incantation, instructing Ash to repeat after her, which he failed to manage. When nothing happened, Ash threatened the demon, who argued back, blaming his poor pronunciation. Their combined exchange of Sumerian words triggered a hiss from the showers behind them. The wet tiled floor darkened, and the pipes burst. A whirlpool of dirty water, shower curtains, and used toilet paper swallowed the demon, while Ash held onto a locker door, which slowly slipped from his fingers.<br><br><i>FFFUUUC—</i><br><br>Ash landed flat on his chest in the realm of The Entity, sputtering grass. He got up, brushing off the dry clothes he suddenly had on. Then he looked around and his grin fell. It was the kind of place that made two things obvious: one, there wasn’t any bar for miles, and two, he was going to need his shotgun and chainsaw, both of which he lacked. As he started to walk toward a glinting light ahead, a scream rippled through the trees.<br><br><i>Groovy.</i>",

During high school, his anxious nature was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he discovered an interest for heavy metal and started a vinyl collection. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make some art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents’ constant fighting.<br><br>To escape his parents’ increasingly recurrent blow-ups, Jeff started working at a video store. Few customers passed by, so he had a lot of free time to draw. A late-night regular noticed his sketches and asked him to do some artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.

    "E3A9CECC4B3881CD4738A1B9917017E3": "Jane Romero was the daughter of famous actress, Loretta Lawrence, of whom she had no memory. Her parents had separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother’s absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.<br><br>As a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother’s talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio-station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.<br><br>After graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show’s executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio-station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being <i>too risky</i>.<br><br>Four months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a co-host to spark up the failing show, <i>Quick Talk</i>.<br><br>Live television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of <i>Quick Talk</i> and pushed for a relatable coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show’s viewership was steadily growing.<br><br>After two years, she launched a full-hour segment called <i>The Jane Romero Show</i>, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J.R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.<br><br>But Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it <i>a serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips</i>. Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements.<br>Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learned that her mother had agreed to star in her show.<br><br>Jane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but when her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane’s stomach lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta interrupted her, saying that they were not actually related. The interview went haywire after that.<br><br>After the show, Jane was driving to her father’s house in New Jersey. She needed to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself lately. She turned on a freeway along the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some pain killers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked to sharpen their outlines, but each time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and slower, until they remained shut, for a moment too long.<br><br>The following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane’s car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks, they were unable to retrieve her body.<br><br>The airing and production of <i>The Jane Romero Show</i> was suspended until after her funeral, which her father and mother attended.<br><br>As the public grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders for J.R. products and all her episodes were re-released a month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.",

Although their plan had seemed to work flawlessly, Freddy Krueger had beaten death yet again.<br><br>But Quentin wasn’t about to give up. It might take many attempts, but he vowed that somehow he would find a way to beat Freddy, once and for all. If he didn’t, it would only be a matter of time before Freddy would win and Nancy was lost.<br><br>Someone like Quentin never attracted attention in a library, no matter how strange the texts he requested were. He devoured all the information he could, on shared dream worlds, lucid dreaming, and the methods to control the dream space.

He tested this skill carefully, not wanting to show his hand, hoping that it would give him some kind of advantage that he could use to defeat Freddy. <br><br>Then, one night, he found himself in the familiar environment of Badham Preschool. Freddy had tired of the taunting and had finally decided to gut him.<br><br>Quentin ran through the school, his quick eyes scanning for something useful in the maze of rooms. He found a can of paint thinner and quickly formulated a plan. <br><br>Once the trap was set, he waited, acting as the lure to draw Freddy into the right position. And there he was, claws scraping on metal as he closed in for the kill. <br><br>Quentin allowed himself time to enjoy the surprise on Freddy’s face as the corridor ignited and then he was away, running through the building, heading for the exit that he knew existed.

    "D272C1434872D1DA237F618B163537F7": "Felix Richter was born to Janos and Ursula Richter in Coburg, Germany, where the Richter family had deep connections and were among the most respected of its physicians. His parents, both members of an ancient society, were always out of the Richter manor at medical conferences or providing humanitarian aid around the world. Travelling exposed young Felix to new cultures, languages, and architecture unlike anything he had ever seen before. He wasn’t sure when the architectural bug bit, but when it did, it bit hard, and he knew that despite his family’s legacy, he would one day design buildings that would inspire the world. By 23, he was considered an architectural prodigy having won the Swiss Architect Medal and the German National Design Award.  Yet despite his success, Felix couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling that his success had more to do with luck and connections than talent and hard work.<br><br>Growing up, Felix was socially awkward and introverted, preferring his imagination to the company of others. He had few friends so when he wasn't traveling with his parents, Felix was in his father’s library devouring rare books, studying history and architecture, soaking up anything and everything he could on architectural movements throughout the centuries.  His father hoped young Felix would learn to be more outgoing and hired every possible specialist to help improve his social skills. When these efforts failed, he threw in the proverbial towel and figured his son would learn when he was ready. He then joined young Felix in the library, where he helped him build elaborate wooden models of buildings while telling him wild stories about his secret club and their ancient battle against a dark and ominous force. Stories, Felix was sure, his father had made up to make his ‘Imperiatti’ group sound cooler than it actually was.<br><br>Felix sometimes wondered if his design sensibilities came from his summer trips to Dyer Island, a private island that boasted some of the world's finest homes and designs. Every summer, Felix would accompany his parents to the island, where members of The Imperiatti would encourage their children to network and forge lifelong connections. Felix didn’t mingle well with the other teenagers, but he did make four friends who like himself didn’t quite fit the ‘high-society’ mold. They were often ridiculed by other teens and disparagingly called ‘The Pariahs,' a name they liked and gladly adopted. Instead of practicing public speaking and engaging in endless debates, The Pariahs spent most of their time exploring the ruins and mysteries of the island until one of their adventures took a turn for the worse.  \n\nExploring an abandoned internment camp, they descended into what seemed to be an underground laboratory where they uncovered old, leather journals with illustrations and notes of inhumane experiments conducted on prisoners of the First Opium War held by the British East India Company. As they pushed through a locked door, they found a chamber scattered with human skeletons and dusty vials filled with an unknown serum. Before they could examine the contents, the ground seemed to shake beneath their feet and a hissing sound filled their ears. A strange fog suddenly appeared and giant claws seemed to burst from the ground as dark imagination mingled with reality to terrorize them. Before they understood what was happening, Felix’s father and several other parents came to their rescue, using strange tools and objects to protect them. Felix stared at the scene in shock and disbelief. He wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or living one of his father’s ridiculous, supernatural stories. By the time he realized it wasn’t a dream, it was all over. The Pariahs were safe, but their parents had mysteriously disappeared without a trace.  \n\nAfter the shock of his father’s disappearance, Felix searched for any theory that could help him understand the phenomena he had encountered on the island. He exchanged notes with The Pariahs and other people he had met online who had also lost loved ones in a similar way. The tragedy had fostered a strong relationship between The Pariahs and for years they worked together to unravel the mystery of what had happened to their parents.  But nothing made sense, and every lead they pursued hit a dead end. With time their efforts dwindled, and the five friends slowly grew apart, each going their separate ways, hoping to forget the nameless darkness that had robbed them of their parents.   \n\nOver the years, Felix proved to be an exceptional architect, though he found little inspiration working for others. He realized his father was right. His lack of social skills was holding him back. With dedication and purpose, he improved his diction and decorum and learned how to network or ‘play-act’ as he liked to call it. He created the perfect façade to make himself more likable and popular with potential clients. After working for several architectural firms, he established his firm with his colleague Lauren Golder. Both shared a similar vision and were philosophically opposed to formulaic modernist buildings, often experimenting with unusual materials, shapes and structures.  \n\nFelix continued to undermine traditional expectations in favor of the edgy and unconventional devices that set the architectural world abuzz. But even with all the accolades, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was a phony, like an actor who had learned a part instead of a true architect who had inspired the world with an impeccable design. During these moments of insecurity and self-doubt, he would distract himself with endless parties and drown his anxieties in alcohol, wishing his father was still around for some harsh advice and tempered wisdom.<br><br>Eventually, Felix’s girlfriend announced that he was going to be a father. The news shook him to the core and, wanting to inspire his unborn child as much as his father inspired him, he quickly pulled his life together. What he needed was a project that would challenge him and cement his worth as an architect. As fate would have it, the perfect opportunity presented itself when old friends of his father commissioned his firm ‘Richter and Golder’ to build something new and unconventional on Dyer Island. The challenge excited and terrified Felix, who now drowned his anxieties with articles and books on parenting.<br><br>Within six months, the Dyer Restoration Project was underway, and as Felix surveyed the island, he suddenly heard a familiar voice calling out to him from beyond the shattered Victorian buildings and the crumbling ruins hiding dark stories long hidden and forgotten.  Through a strange, gathering fog, he saw a form slowly take shape. His eyes widened, and his lips parted, but no words issued forth. Could it be? Was it possible? No... it couldn’t be... it was... impossible... and yet...<br><br>With dawning realization, Felix staggered back as he watched his father emerge from the fog. His legs felt weak, and his rising heartbeat thrashed in his ears. It was him. It was really him. His unborn child would know his grandfather, and he could finally show him how much he had accomplished since he disappeared. They stared at one another for a long moment. Then his father gave him a look of disappointment, turned his back on him, and proceeded to walk away. Over his pounding heart, Felix chased after him and was never seen again.",

    "AC790AFE4AF45EF78B840FAD57F7C7EA": "Born into a lush Parisian household, Élodie Rakoto grew up in a comfortable home miles away from the verdant island of Madagascar, her parents' birthplace. Her backpack was always heavy and usually contained no schoolwork. She carried the essentials: a few history books, some printed maps, and a compact shovel. Instead of wasting away with regurgitated facts from her classes, she explored the city to discover the stories behind each statue, neighborhood, and street sign. She collected bits and pieces of Paris, making it her own.<br><br>When she was fourteen, her parents took her to Dyer Island for a 'business trip.' To her grand disappointment, the island was a private site for exclusive members of the Imperiatti. She was forced to attend pretentious and awkward social mixers daily.  After a few weeks on the island, she met the Pariahs, like-minded teenagers who had no interest in being pawns for their parents' political chessboard. On dull, rainy nights she would convince them to sneak out and explore the island unsupervised.<br><br>One foggy evening, they stumbled upon an abandoned internment camp. Felix, one of the Pariahs, didn’t want to go in, but Élodie insisted. Inside, they found a strange underground laboratory in ruins. The Pariahs grew excited, browsing through the strange apparatuses for trophies and mementos. But Élodie noticed something in the far-left corner of the wall: odd scratches in the shape of a circle. She ran her fingernails against the cool concrete—the marks were deep and narrow. A warm whisper suddenly sent her mind adrift—<br><br>—Deep, rumbling thunder. Black, glistening waves. An ashen sanded beach. Incomplete. She was compelled to touch the ice-cold sand and draw a circle with a line in the middle.<br><br>A sharp thunderclap and lightning whipped the sky. The ground shook as sleek, obsidian claws tore through the concrete floor, ripping the earth open. The building began to collapse and Élodie spotted her mother wielding a bizarre instrument while her father told her to run. Then--<br><br>Complete darkness.<br><br>Élodie never saw her parents again.<br><br>For years, this nightmare woke her in the middle of the night, cold, sweating, shaking like a leaf. As a child she suffered from night terrors and often resisted going to bed. To soothe her mind, her grandma would light a tea candle and tell her stories until the wick extinguished in a hot pool of liquified wax. The perfume of the warm vanilla-scented wax would lull Élodie to sleep as she envisioned stories of legendary heroes defeating fear and foes. Élodie had forgotten the stories, but she still remembered her longing for the verdant Malagasy rainforests and colossal mountains that her grandmother described. When Élodie felt cold and numb with grief, she would light a vanilla-scented candle and summon her childhood memories of this distant, idyllic place, raising her spirits to rise above her crippling depression.<br><br>Fourteen years later, Élodie still searched for the missing pieces of the puzzle. No rational explanation could explain her parents' disappearance, so she had been looking elsewhere. She researched any and all legends that mentioned a dark force that snatched people at night without a trace. From there, she translated old tales and built a tapestry of narratives from around the world that corroborated the uncanny way her parents had vanished on Dyer's island. She also gathered artifacts made by ancient civilizations who sought to destroy or resurrect the incomprehensible and indescribable Thing that took her parents. There were various names for it, differing from one language to the next: The Abyss, The Infinite, The Hole.<br><br>Her findings pushed her further into the dark field of occultism. The Pariahs were long gone. She'd alienated them with her theories. But she refused to give up on her parents.<br><br>Élodie set out into the cold, misty evening. She turned a corner, leaving Paris' 13th arrondissement, an eccentric neighborhood with a substantial library dating from the middle ages. She had pressing work to do for Hazra Shah, the Collector, an occult specialist who archived rare artifacts.<br><br>He’d recruited her after she’d salvaged a rare stolen Maori statue of spidery fangs like the claws she'd seen on Dyer's island. For the next five years, Élodie had been procuring occult relics for the Collector. In exchange, he provided large sums of money, equipment, and precise information about obscure manuscripts.<br><br>Just as the Collector requested, she had secured the annals of a witch trial convicting a mother birthing conjoined twins in the 17th century. According to legend, an occult incantation was engraved on a set of skulls, all of which the Collector possessed except one—the witch's skull. There were no traces of where the skull was now, but Élodie had found a newspaper article dating back to the same year, mentioning that most remains had been relocated to the catacombs to avoid a pandemic. Élodie was acting on a hunch. Breaking into the catacombs to retrieve a lost skull involved certain risks, but no more than the previous work she'd done for the Collector.<br><br>With a flashlight, she followed the ancient layout of the catacombs and spotted a collapsed wall. A few large stones blocked the way in. She grabbed her portable XRF analyzer and scanned the materials of the wall. Working for the Collector had its perks. The brick mortar had been poorly mixed, showing high traces of sand. The whole thing was brittle, and the ground was moist from the damp evening air. This was her way in.<br><br>The journey beneath was long and treacherous. The air was heavy and moldy. She gasped when her key-chain flashlight hit an endless wall of bleached-white skulls.<br><br>Something cracked behind her. She spun around and collided headfirst with a baseball bat. Pain exploded in her skull and darkness filled her view.<br><br>When she came to, a man was carrying her over his shoulder, venturing deeper inside the catacombs. He was wearing a dark robe.<br><br>The Black Vale.<br><br>She'd managed to elude them until now. Ruthless and lethal, they went by many names. She'd figured out that they ultimately all worked for the same group, a ring of occult fanatics rumored to perform human sacrifices for what they called The Old One. She had to get out of here fast.<br><br>Élodie spotted a loose skull on the wall, grabbed it and smashed it on her assaulter's head. Stunned, the man lost his balance and Élodie hit the ground running. As she turned a corner, she suddenly felt a sharp pain to her side.<br><br>She looked down and saw a large blade planted there. Shocked, she removed the knife and warm blood spurted out.<br><br>Her heartbeat rang in her ears as her vision blurred.<br><br>She fell to her knees. Summoning all her strength, she drew a circle on the ground with a shaking, blood-red finger and traced a line in the middle.<br><br>An opaque heaviness fell over her shoulders. A familiar scent of vanilla-spiked fruits and lychee nuts coated the air. Thin, tropical rain drizzled down leafy vines. Warmth.<br><br>Madagascar.<br><br>A ghostly cry erupted from the thick foliage.<br><br>Élodie looked up and the vines turned into hissing snakes. The soft canopy soil suddenly turned ashen and collapsed under her feet. She sank into something dense and cold that swallowed her like quicksand. She screamed, before being smothered by... the abyss...the infinite... the hole...<br><br>She found what she had been searching for.",

When she turned ten, however, she lost her instruments. Her family was heavily in debt and did not make the payments in time. The creditors took everything they owned, including the house. Yun-Jin held her four-year-old sister tightly as she cried. They moved into a windowless, two-bedroom basement. Since her parents worked day and night to pay their debt, Yun-Jin became her sister's caretaker. Every night she sang until they both fell asleep.<br><br>At seventeen, the renowned record label Mightee One Entertainment came to her high school to audition talent.  She was rejected as an idol trainee but obtained an unpaid internship at the studio. For the following years, she created some of the studio's biggest hits, without any credit or recognition. To get her dues, she emerged in the public eye wearing flamboyant fashion and put soundbites into her songs that looped her artist name, Magnum Opus. Fans began to recognize her songs and she became the producer of NO SPIN, a poorly performing boy band who needed her special touch.<br><br>Dissatisfied with NO SPIN's commercial sound, she sought a rogue element to make the band stand out. Through her contacts in talent shows she found the edgy, raw sound of Ji-Woon Hak. She re-launched NO SPIN with Ji-Woon as its newest member. Within hours their first video was a viral sensation.<br><br>Their success cemented Yun-Jin’s reputation as a shrewd producer. Adorned in high fashion to attend luxurious events, Yun-Jin's harsh, impoverished childhood seemed far behind her. She moved into a penthouse and dined with socialites in skyline restaurants with breathtaking views of Seoul.<br><br>The success of the first album broke records, setting the bar high for NO SPIN's second. As they were recording new tracks, the fire alarm suddenly blared. Concerned for her safety, Yun-Jin hurried to evacuate the building and left the dallying staff behind.

A goliath of flames engulfed the building, slowly tamed by the steady streams of fire hoses.<br><br>All members of NO SPIN perished in the fire except one: Ji-Woon. The album was ruined. The band was over. She would be shelved while Ji-Woon would rot away as an instructor for idol trainees. But she refused to be a victim who watched helplessly as vultures swooped in to take what was hers.<br><br>Unknown to Mightee One Entertainment, she created new tracks to re-launch Ji-Woon's career. She pushed him to tap into his grief and create a song exploring the pangs of sudden loss. The music video showed Ji-Woon saying goodbye to each member of NO SPIN. Yun-Jin cleverly launched the song under Ji-Woon's newly adopted stage name: The Trickster. He would embody both fear and awe like the legendary dokkaebi spirits.<br><br>Ji-Woon's song was a global phenomenon, its universal themes of grief and guilt resonating internationally. Together, Yun-Jin and The Trickster toured the world. Success greeted them on every shore. Yet disturbingly, so did a series of eccentric murders. This connection unsettled Yun-Jin as she noticed that the tour dates coincided with the victims' time of death. She was weary after the loss of NO SPIN and anxious to preserve her artist, so she increased the Trickster's security detail. What if the serial killer was an unhinged fan fixated on the Trickster, inspired by the artist's morbid songs?<br><br>Returning to Seoul, Yun-Jin worked with Ji-Woon on his new material. When she entered the studio at the brink of dawn, she was surprised to see Ji-Woon already there. He seemed exhausted, like he had worked all night. When she listened to his track, she discovered a bizarre intro filled with shrieks and snares. It was too experimental for her taste.<br><br>A week later, another death was reported. The body showed traces of torture and was arranged in the same flamboyant style as previous murders, this time diamond Cufflinks gouged into the victim's eyes. The following day, the victim was on every television channel. A video from the victim's social media showed her squealing, surprised when her boyfriend handed her a heart-shaped, birthday cake. Yun-Jin's stomach churned. That voice. So familiar. And yet, she had never met the victim.<br><br>The next morning, her heart froze when she listened to the Trickster's opening track. The shrieks in his song matched the victim's squeal. Did he sample the victim's birthday video? No, that was impossible: he had recorded this song before the murder was reported. She stared at Ji-Woon on the other side of the booth's glass window. He was NO SPIN's only survivor. Everyone else was dead. Not to mention the eccentric murders that matched his tour dates. Death trails that seemed to converge… to him.<br><br>If he caused… this, no artist would survive the scandal. Yun-Jin's career, no, her life would be over. All she had would be destroyed. A wave of nausea surged over her. Heart racing, she rushed to the restroom. Wild thoughts blazed through her mind as she splashed icy water over her face. There had to be a simpler explanation. Perhaps she was overworked. Or maybe, she did not trust her success. Her mind was fabricating this suspicion because disaster was easier to trust than success. It was all in her head. She returned to the recording booth, eager to put her worries behind her.<br><br>Months later, pressure came from Mightee One Entertainment executives. Revenue was down and they blamed the Trickster since they disapproved the violent themes in his music and the knife tricks he pulled during performances. While Yun-Jin was furious they scapegoated her artist, she agreed that Ji-Woon's sound was too niche to generate profit. She told Ji-Woon she fought them off but was ultimately outnumbered. Because of her initial fury, he believed her to be on his side. They were given three months to create and perform the next hit for Mightee One.<br><br>Months flew by and the time came for Yun-Jin to take a seat at the executives' private show. She was confident about her song but as soon as the music started, she knew something was amiss.<br><br>Dense, foul smoke permeated the room. Yun-Jin coughed and gasped for air. But the more she coughed, the more she inhaled. Her body sank in the chair, her limbs heavy and numb, and her eyes widened as she watched, terrified, a nightmare come to life.<br><br>The Trickster was a whirlwind of blood, slashing, stabbing, and chopping limbs. The executives were carved up like meat. They could not run. They were stuck, like Yun-Jin, paralyzed. A boiling rage swelled in her gut. How could she have denied her instincts? The fire. The murders on tour. It was him. It had always been him. And she had known from the start. Now her career was over, and so was Mightee One. Everyone she had worked with, her colleagues, her friends, dying before her eyes. Everything she had, taken from her once more.<br><br>No, she would not let him. He would pay. He would know her suffering. Suddenly, dark coils of black fog rose from the ground and she was... somewhere else.<br><br>Bright lights flashed and blinded her. A spotlight found her in the darkness. Then a crowd erupted, chanting her name. \"Magnum Opus! Magnum Opus!\"<br><br>She smiled and welcomed the darkness within. ",

    "A60A387F424B30CBB72981B7CD6E88FB": "Mikaela Reid was sixteen when her father passed away. She would always miss his sailing lessons at dawn, his colorful yet inedible tacos, and his warm, contagious laughter. She felt like she was paddling in a vast storm-black ocean, each rolling wave submerging her. Drifting in painful darkness, she almost lost herself, but resiliently, with love and care, she made her way back to shore. <br><br> Well-surrounded and supported by her friends, Mikaela put the past behind her and looked at life in a new light. She was excited to try new things and discovered storytelling as an outlet. Her friends liked her stories of daunting danger and hard-earned survival.  She read horror stories more and more, savoring the powerful, heart-pounding escapism it provided. Autumn became her favorite season and she threw a grand production for Halloween every year, hosting all her friends for a thrilling night of horror stories, scary games, and homemade treats. <br><br> Over the years, she also showed interest in witchcraft and practiced light blessings, plant-based spells, and palm-reading divination. She gardened sage, mugwort, and lavender to craft homemade products such as body butters, soaps and skin lotions. She aspired one day to live off the products she made for friends and family. <br><br> In the meantime, she worked as a barista at the Moonstone, an independent and eccentric coffee shop in the artsy part of town. Every Friday night, she hosted an open mic at the coffee shop, performing stories live in front of customers. Julian, her best friend and roommate, recorded some of her shows and posted them online. Also, unbeknown to her, he submitted one of her performances to the Endless Halloween Festival where renown storytellers performed on stage for Halloween. <br><br> It was a beautiful surprise when Mikaela received an email from the festival inviting her to perform at their grand final on Halloween. The winning prize was big enough for her to launch her line of products. Excited, she burnt a stick of herbs in each room to dissipate negative energies, then began to craft her tale of horror. <br><br> Mikaela stayed up all night filling her notebooks with abandoned beginnings. She had a story in mind, but unearthing it took patience and skill. The following night, the nightmares began. For a week, she would wake in the middle of the night gasping for air. Her dream was the same every night.  She was dragged down a cold set of stairs and thrown into a dark basement. Then her lungs would be set ablaze by a sharp iron hook stabbing her in the chest. A dark figure would pull on the hook and hoist her from the ground, slowly, until the pain waked her. The more she finessed her Halloween tale, the darker her nightmares grew. <br><br> As days passed, exhaustion, anxiety, and stress took a toll on her. Often distracted, her coffees at the Moonstone were rushed, acrid, or going to the wrong customer. She no longer blessed the coffee beans in the morning nor looked for omens in the leftover coffee grains. Her energy was low, and her magic felt drained. <br><br> When she woke up screaming one night, she had had enough. She asked Julian to watch her while she slept and record anything unusual. Julian agreed and started recording while Mikaela lay on her bed. <br><br> Minutes later, her fingers began to twitch, then her toes. Her breath became labored. Then Julian stared in shock as Mikaela slowly rose in the air, levitating over her bed. Panicked, he shook her shoulders to wake her, but stopped when she began to scream. He grabbed his phone to call an ambulance, but a powerful crash diverted his attention. He looked down the hallway and saw a large, spidery fang slam through the bathroom door. <br><br> Amidst the commotion, Mikaela awoke. She saw the black spidery fang shredding the bathroom door and jumped out of bed. She slammed her bedroom door shut and shouted at Julian to help her barricade the door. Before he could react, however, the power went out. The room was submerged in sudden darkness. <br><br> A second later, the lights came back on and an eerie quietness followed. Mikaela and Julian ventured out the bedroom carefully. The bathroom door looked intact and there was no sign of anything abnormal. But Julian had recorded every sound. <br><br> A sleepless night followed. When she returned to the apartment after her shift, Julian was not there. Mikaela wanted him to remove the recording of their ordeal, which he had posted online. Suspecting Julian might be at school, she left. The door clicked shut behind her, masking a stifled cry from the bathroom. <br><br> As she neared her car, she looked over her shoulder. Mikaela felt... watched. She whispered a protective spell and clutched her keys. Suddenly, a shadow pounced on the wall and she broke into a run. She reached her car and rushed inside, locking the doors. Breathing hard, she looked through the windows. No one was there. Perhaps it was her nerves playing tricks on her. She turned on the ignition and drove off. <br><br> The next day, Julian was still nowhere to be found. Mikaela had contacted everyone she knew. She looked for him all day and waited for him all night. Distraught and anxious, she missed her shift at the Moonstone.  Halloween was tonight and so was the festival. Julian had entered the storytelling competition for her. He had supported her every time she doubted herself. Maybe he would be there. But between her nightmares and Julian's disappearance, she had been too worried to prepare a story for the contest. She looked at her notebook, filled with false starts. She could stay home, scared and sleepless. Or she could finish what Julian had started. There was a reason why she loved to tell horror stories. They made her feel brave enough to face any challenge. <br><br>That evening when the host called Mikaela's name at the Endless Halloween Festival, she boldly stepped on stage, dressed in costume: a black dress matched with a wide, witchy hat. She hoped to spot Julian in the crowd. But she could not find him and looking directly at the audience was a mistake.  A sea of expectant faces was before her, eyes watching her every move. Her heart pounded in her chest as her hands began to shake. <br><br> She grabbed the warm microphone and cleared her throat. A thick silence greeted her, only interrupted by a distant cough. She reminded herself that tonight was All Hallows' Eve, when the veil thinned betwixt this realm and the one beyond. She had a story in her heart, a story that mattered. If she told it right, perhaps Julian would hear it. <br><br> Mikaela took a deep breath. The wet wind of Autumn whirled golden leaves around her. She inhaled the acrid smell of damp, foliage. She swallowed the bitter aftertaste of coffee still on her tongue. Distant crows cawed from an old oak tree. She closed her eyes. The crimson darkness under her eyelids turned darker. Her heartbeat slowed. She exhaled deeply, her breath a puff of mist in the cold night air. Now she felt awakened, refreshed for the first time in weeks, and ready to tell the tale of a lifetime. <br><br>She spoke into the microphone in a deep, haunting voice. She narrated a tale of billowing winds on a cold Autumn night. Of a loyal friend disappearing before daylight. Of forgotten victims hiding in the wings of darkness. Of throbbing graves, sealed with terrible secrets. And of eternal night in the shadow of death. <br><br>Mikaela pointed at the night sky and said that no darkness was truly beyond light. Even on this moonless night, the sky shined with long-dead stars. <br><br> A thick black fog engulfed Mikaela, to the audience's amazement. <br><br> And no one saw Mikaela Reid again.\n",

    "7BD01EDF47846C657103BCA121F0F342": "Jonah Vasquez saw the truth behind the veil. His gifted mind understood numbers in a way few could. Sunsets, architecture, a blade of grass—he saw more within them than eyes could gleam. He understood the language that explained them—mathematics—complex equations that continually played out around the universe to determine why and how we exist. Structures. Patterns. A law unbroken: physics.<br><br>His gift would have been overlooked had his family’s history of poverty continued for another generation. But some patterns are meant to deviate from their common course, and Jonah’s father strived to better his family with every muscle he had. What started as a job picking fruit near Fresno, California, eventually led to him owning a small mangrove. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to provide Jonah a stable childhood and education.<br><br>Though placed in advanced classes, there were few signs of Jonah’s brilliance to his peers. He was a normal boy with a few close friends, a passion for baseball, and an interest in ancient civilizations. However, when he was alone, his mind turned to numbers—and these, to Jonah, were the most fascinating of marvels. He delved into Fibonacci and Recaman’s sequences and was soon poring over complex equations from history's leading mathematicians.<br><br>On his 16th birthday, he received an unaddressed card. There was nothing within but the following numbers: <b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b><br><br>It was a puzzle. Perhaps a gift from his math teacher or a relative who knew of his penchant for solving brainteasers. But somehow this was different. While he immediately recognized the GPS coordinates, quickly discovering they led to a location in Chile, the other numbers meant nothing to him. Every attempt he made led to failure.<br><br>Over time, he abandoned the puzzle, convinced it was flawed. He went on to university and, upon graduation, was hired as a codebreaker by the CIA. On his first day, written in his employee handbook, were the numbers from years ago: <b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b>. A tension in the back of his neck materialized, a feeling that he was being toyed with. He returned to the puzzle, only to discover that his years of experience would reveal no new information. He couldn’t dwell on it—he had a job to do.<br><br>He was put to work deciphering messages from signal stations around Europe. Archived footage found that for twenty-three years dozens had been operating in an unknown capacity. Simple blinks of light hid complex codes that revealed disjointed information. It wasn’t much to go on, but he discovered the messages seemed to involve powerful and wealthy individuals from around the globe.<br><br>The project was abruptly shut down. All agents involved were transferred to other assignments. Jonah was moved to a covert task force in the newly formed democracy of Kwantana, where he intercepted and decoded messages from bands of rebels. His work enabled the U.S. to target numerous rebel locations. Then the bombs dropped.<br><br>It was discovered too late that the messages were decoys. Civilian casualties were staggering, the true numbers covered up by officials.  Jonah blamed himself. He saw firsthand the damage done and the families torn apart. He took a leave of absence but remained in Kwantana, surveying the damage. He had to do something. He cashed in his favors with one of the CIA’s digital security experts and infiltrated the rebellion’s computer network. From there, he took stock of the numbers, and made changes he thought no one would notice. Small amounts of money were siphoned from the rebels to those who lost their homes and loved ones.<br><br>It seemed like a smooth play, undetectable and bloodless—until the day the gunshots rang through his suite. Jonah hit the floor as glass shattered and holes punched through his walls. Grabbing his laptop, he broke his kitchen window and leapt to the neighboring building’s roof. Before he could even rub his throbbing ankles, the small house exploded into flames. He ran, not looking back. He climbed down to the alley, made his way to the slums, and concealed himself among rickety shanties of cardboard and rotting wood. A week later, he arrived at an American embassy, exhausted, dust-ridden, and defeated.<br><br>Before he could take a breath, he received a call from his chief officer at the CIA: \"Was it worth it? You over this crusade of yours?\"<br><br>He felt powerless. And so, he returned his focus to what was simple, what was black and white: numbers.<br><br>His chief officer gave him a new assignment, one classified to all but a few. His research on the signal stations had reached someone high up, and the project was re-opened under a veil of secrecy. Jonah dedicated his time to deciphering the codes, partly out of fascination and partly to forget the guilt that resided within him. What started with signal stations led him to something even more baffling: horror podcasts.<br><br>In the stories of campfire thrillers and slasher tales from around the world were carefully concealed codes. Sometimes numbers. Sometimes words. Each time, as if being a secret password or handshake, he found the following message: Sacrifice is rebirth. Hidden in the code was information on a network of powerful people, all working towards what, he didn’t know. There was chatter of summonings and rebirths, sacrifices and hunts. Jonah assumed much of it was red herrings attempting to mislead. Up late that night, he analyzed another code—this time concealed in a story of vampires. What he deciphered sent a chill through his spine.<b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b><br><br>The numbers had returned. They haunted him. He saw them when he closed his eyes. They clung to his sleepless mind, begging for attention. He checked the coordinates as he had years ago—it was nothing but a Chilean graveyard. He logged into the CIA database and searched the history of the location. Only one hit came up: a cold case where bodies were found in the area, the corpses eaten by hundreds of crows.<br><br>Jonah couldn’t let the mystery go on any longer. The numbers had followed him all his life and he was ready to follow them. Knowing his chief officer wouldn’t approve, he booked a ticket to Chile without anyone’s knowledge. It was time to see what was so special about the coordinates. Less than 24 hours later he arrived at –20.36, -69.85. He found himself under the sweltering sun, standing in the graveyard of a ghost town.<br><br>There was nothing but dust and bones. Jonah spit into the dirt and puzzled over the numbers once more. He slumped next to an old grave, under the eyes of a watchful crow. He missed home, he missed the mangrove, he missed a time before the complexities of the universe crashed down on him. He looked out at the old derelict buildings on one side and the sweeping desert on the other. There were similarities to Fresno—the dry heat, the sunset that cast an orange glow on the dusty ground. But it wasn’t home. Not to him. He looked at it from the eyes of a man who didn’t belong in this place.<br><br>And then Jonah understood.<br><br>He was analyzing the code from his own experiences, his own view of the world. There was so much he overlooked. With feverish devotion, he considered what the numbers could signify for other cultures: ancient Egyptian measurements, Persian currencies, and... antiquated calendars. He finally understood.<br><br>He sifted through his knowledge of ancient civilizations before coming to the Tanyrian calendar. Plugging in the numbers as dates, he converted the first half of them over to the Gregorian calendar. He wasn’t prepared for the number it would reveal: his birthday. The world spiraled around him. With sweaty palms, he calculated the remaining numbers. It gave him another date: today.<br><br>The code... it was about Jonah, at this location, at this moment. His hands shook. His heart pounded against his ribs. Was he part of a prophecy or had someone led him down this path? He didn't know. For once, numbers no longer made sense.<br><br>A heavy fatigue came over him and the world shifted in impossible ways. He knew the equations behind nature, he knew what he saw couldn’t be. He witnessed his father’s mangrove beyond the desert and felt overwhelming comfort. Crows cawed in the distance and the smell of citrus wafted on the breeze. He considered that he was once more a child, and the numbers nothing but a horrible dream. Trapped in nostalgic thoughts, he didn't notice the dark fog seeping from the grass, swirling its way towards him. Crows flew from the branches, screeching relentlessly, flying in a circle above. It was too late when he realized the scent on the breeze was no longer citrus.<br><br>It was blood. ",

Her father did his best to steer her away from what he believed to be masculine pursuits, but her grandmother secretly shared her grandfather’s engineer manuals and notes on car and motorcycle engines. Yui read her grandfather’s manuals and learned fast. She was able to not only maintain her scooter, but she modified the engine so that she could compete with older boys on motor crosses. With her grandfathers ‘good luck hachimaki’ wrapped around her arm, she raced local boys who, unable to keep up with her, worked together to orchestrate her defeat. No luck for them. Yui outmaneuvered them at every turn and became a sensation to all her friends.  When it came time to apply for school, Yui gathered her courage and confessed her ambition to race motorcycles to her father. An altercation ensued and when Yui refused to apply for a proper education, her father felt a great shame and told her she was no longer welcome in their home. With a heavy heart, Yui left for Nagoya with the blessings and savings of her grandmother.<br><br>Nagoya was not what Yui expected. She could only find low grade clerical work or minor jobs as a hostess. With the last of the money her grandmother gave her, she purchased a racing bike and entered illegal street races where she won more money than she had ever seen. Rumors of her courage and quick reflexes spread like wildfire. Soon she had an unofficial retinue of women motorcyclists wearing Yui’s signature pink. Along with a gang following her, Yui realized she had a stalker following her in the shadows. When Yui realized her lucky handkerchief had been stolen from her apartment, she took her concerns to the police who laughed and dismissed her, saying her stalker was probably a nice guy and that she would probably marry him in the near future.<br><br>One evening Yui returned home to find the stalker in her apartment going through her things. He hadn’t seen her, and she wasn’t sure what she should do. But the sight of him going through her clothes was too much to bear. She yelled for him to leave.  The stalker turned to her with a knife. He lunged at her.  She evaded his attack, and he hit the wall and dropped his knife. Without hesitation, Yui tackled him. They rolled over the ground exchanging desperate blows. Yui took more blows than she had ever experienced racing scooters in Shirakawa. With a surge of adrenaline, she managed to overpower her stalker, snatching the knife from the floor and holding the razor-sharp blade to his neck.<br><br>When the police reached her apartment, they took him away and rushed Yui to the hospital for trauma. X-rays revealed she had broken her arm and foot in several places. It wasn’t long before her gang showed up one by one and together they helped her pay her medical bills.  Rehabilitation was difficult but Yui never gave up and with the support of her gang she was ready for the races. Yui’s first race after the attack her gang presented her with a new pink hachimaki with their signatures and good luck messages written all over it. Yui vowed she would help other women with her winnings and influence. True to her word, her gang became known as the Sakura 7 Gang and they wore pink hachimakis as a symbol of unity and support for women needing help from stalkers and abusers.<br><br>The Sakura 7 grew beyond the 7 members and Yui’s signature pink became synonymous with women’s empowerment. At street races women would line up in droves to support her. After winning seven straight races in a row, she attracted the attention of a sponsor. She not only earned a spot at the All-Japan Moto Championship but was the youngest woman to race and win in the prestigious event. Her sponsorship soon tripled. So, too, did her gang. But everything came to a staggering halt at the illegal TK3 (Tokyo Kick 3000) street races. Yui was leading the race until she entered an unnatural fog that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. Baffled and confused, she stopped her bike and dismounted. It wasn’t long before she realized she wasn’t in Tokyo anymore.  ",

She felt this cultural difference painted a target on her back. To avoid ridicule and bullies, she observed what popular kids liked and learned to project the image they preferred. At school, she would go by the name \"Karina,\" dye her hair lighter, and trash her “foreign” lunches.<br><br>At home, the news channel was always on. Urgent reports of injustice captivated Zarina, inspiring her to produce her own stories. When she was a teenager, she embraced her real name and roots and borrowed her father’s digital camera to interview members of her community in Bay Ridge. By posting her content online, she slowly built a loyal following. Each week, she picked a new issue and challenged people to speak their mind on camera.<br><br>When she heard a rumor that a fast-food restaurant owner was exploiting workers, she decided to go undercover and produce a hard-hitting film. She modified her look, faked an accent, and secured a waitress position at the restaurant. After three weeks of unpaid work, she was fired for demanding her paycheck. To retaliate, she posted clips of the restaurant owner’s abusive behavior and within hours the news had picked up her story, but somehow spun it to create sympathy for the restaurant owner.<br><br>Embittered by the experience, Zarina committed to become an independent producer and filmmaker. Her first feature film was for a competition at school inspired by an English class poem about Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian migrants controversially executed for murder. Her film won first prize and launched her as an uncompromising documentary filmmaker.<br><br>Months later, her world turned upside down. A public video surveillance camera filmed her father carrying two coffees at a street corner a few blocks from home. A tall, hooded man stood behind him. The man shouted something at her father who took a step back, startled. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the man pushed him in the street as a car sped by.<br><br>His death sent a shockwave of anger and pain that left Zarina in pieces.<br><br>The perpetrator—Clark Stevenson—was soon arrested and incarcerated for manslaughter.<br><br>Zarina became obsessed with Clark--his gang “IR-28”, his short prison sentence, his apparent lack of remorse. A year went by and she had uncovered enough about Clark to shed more light on his crime. With the last of her inheritance she bought a new camera and a plane ticket to Nebraska and bribed the warden at Hellshire Penitentiary to let her interview Clark.<br><br>She filmed their first meeting and asked him about her father and his gang and his violent tendencies. Clark refused to talk; but, in the weeks that followed, she used her research to push his buttons and finally got a confession of a pre-meditated crime.<br><br>Zarina’s film became a tribute to her father and the trail of blood left by gang violence. When the news finally picked up the story, it was because the film had gained international acclaim.<br><br>Some inmates contacted her when they heard about her documentary. Most of them shared eccentric anecdotes in hopes of being filmed, but one story stood out from the rest: an entire wing in Hellshire Penitentiary was sealed off because of the “Mad Mick Massacre.” The official story was an Irish outlaw had heartlessly slaughtered the warden and his guards.<br><br>From working on her Sacco and Vanzetti film, Zarina knew that the ‘official’ story wasn’t always the ‘true’ story. She investigated Hellshire’s records and found an Irish-American inmate sentenced to twenty years for assault in 1860. According to the penitentiary’s blueprint, the sealed off wing was part of Hellshire’s original infrastructure. If she reached that sealed off section, she could shed some light on the Mad Mick story. All she needed was a way in.<br><br>Next morning, she was joining the Hellshire Penitentiary walking tour. She blended in the crowd of jet-lagged tourists and veered off when they headed toward the kitchen. She’d memorized the blueprint and knew exactly where to go and how to avoid surveyance cameras. An unexpected security detail nearly cut her investigation short, but she was able to hide under an old, dusty prison bed. When the guards disappeared, she continued her search and finally found Mick’s cell.<br><br>Entering the dark, dilapidated cell, Zarina ran her hand across the old brick wall. Her fingers felt a marking and traced the letters: DEATH TO BAYSHORE. A loose brick fell, revealing a gap.<br><br>She inserted her hand. Fingers landed on a piece of cold, cracked metal. She fished it out… an old, rusty wrench. A damp chill ran down her spine and she looked down; a man lay at her feet, bleeding, his limbs contorted and his eyes, dark and terrified—her father’s eyes. A pool of crimson blood on black pavement. Paralyzed, black fog filled the cell and she shut her eyes to push these nightmarish visions out of her mind.",

Often following one‘s path is a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately it’s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization. But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good or bad, must be faced.\n\nHeir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust. As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims took revenge on him. It drew The Entity’s attention and he was deemed worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.\n\nQuick, daring and superstitious, Yui Kimura was one of the youngest motorcyclists to break records in unsanctioned street races as well as the very prestigious Moto Grand Prix of Japan. Breaking with tradition and against her parents’ wishes, she left her home to pursue her dreams of racing and led a gang helping women in troubled situations. Until she found herself roped into another endless race where crossing the finish line was a matter of life and death.",
