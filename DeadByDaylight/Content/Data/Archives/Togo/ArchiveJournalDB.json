See how he laughs with wood and splinters piercing through his stomach.<br><br>Splinters piercing through his throat? Where did those thoughts come from? It’s not like her to think such thoughts. She angles her shinai and feels something strange inside. She's never felt anything like it before. Like… like a waking dragon in her heart. She stares at her grinning opponent. Faster than thought she lunges and strikes the head of her opponent. Everyone laughs at him. His head slumps in mingled defeat and humiliation. A boy stares at her with wide, disbelieving eyes. He blinks. You might be a Yamaoka after all.  She hates to admit it but… it feels good to win. No. Not to win. To defeat a foe. To defeat another human being. Defeat another human being? Why would I think this? These aren’t my thoughts. But they are."

In the end it doesn’t matter. If I could end the Entity I would even if it meant my own demise. My life is little to pay for the salvation of the worlds it will destroy. "
