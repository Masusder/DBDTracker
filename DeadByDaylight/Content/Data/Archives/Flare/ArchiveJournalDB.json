He shakes his head and returns his focus to the moment… to the wild hog he’s been tracking through the woods all morning and afternoon. But he can’t get the thoughts out of his mind. He’s never had such a hard time keeping his focus. When he’s not thinking about food he’s thinking about the past, about home, about the argument. Seems like it happened so long ago. The argument started on Friday and by Monday morning, he was out on his own, exiled from the only life he knew for disobedience. But it wasn’t disobedience. Not to Jake. To Jake it was a need. No. It was more than a need. It was a longing… a profound longing to know where he came from and why his father never talked about him.  \n\nBut you didn’t have to push him so hard, did you?  \n\nI did. I had to. I had to because I had the right to know who he was. Don’t you see? I have an emptiness inside me that no money or thing can fill. Yet… he never told me anything about him… he just distracted himself with the business and all the trappings of a superficial life and—  \n\nRaising you, Jake! Raising his boys!  \n\nJake stares past trampled grass and he hears his mother’s voice resounding through his head. Jake… please… you are expecting a straight thing, and no straight thing has ever been made. Your father isn’t perfect, and everything he’s done is to give you a better life than he had. He has his reasons.  \n\nAnd I have mine!  \n\nJake closes his eyes. He remembers leaving home without saying goodbye. He remembers backpacking across Korea, meeting people who had known his grandfather and could tell him stories about how he had lived. And none of the stories he had been told justified burying the past the way his father had done. He had expected his grandfather to be an abusive, deadbeat and yet… he had discovered a hero… a legend even. He had saved and reunited so many families and so many were grateful and indebted and still… he never mentioned him.  \n\nMaybe he didn’t want a legend, Jake. Maybe he wanted something else. But why does it matter? Why does it matter right now?  \n\nA voice of caution suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. His grandfather’s voice or what he thinks his grandfather would have sounded like. Jake… stop thinking about everything else except what you need to think about. You need to eat before you begin to see things that aren’t there. You’ve been at it all morning and afternoon with that make-shift spear, and if you don’t get the hog you’ll end up like me.  \n\nJake nods with a slight respectful bow as he examines the freshly trampled grass."

He’s hiding. Hiding like the letter his father hid in the attic. Don’t lose your focus, Jake… not now… not again…  \n\nI don’t understand why he would hide such a beautiful letter in a shoebox?  \n\nAh, yes…the letter. It’s the letter that set you off on your journey. It’s the letter that inspired you to learn your father’s language properly. You wanted to translate it for yourself, and you did. But now, Jake, you need to stop thinking about the letter, about your father, about the past… you need to focus on the hunt or none of it will matter anymore. Find food or become food.  \n\nJake winces. His grandfather would never say such a thing. That’s something his father would say. The voices in his head are mixing like a horrible stew of fermenting leftovers. He doesn’t remember when he started hearing the voices but at some point out on his own in the mountains, he realized he was talking to himself and that talking to himself helped him cope with the loneliness.  \n\nEveryone hears voices inside their head, Jake, although most are too distracted to listen or even acknowledge them, or, if they do acknowledge them, they keep them private for fear of ridicule.  \n\nMost of Jake’s voices are family members and old friends that make friendly talk here and there, but as of late the voices poke and question everything he does.  \n\nAnd now for the last two days he was hearing a new voice. A mocking voice that highlighted and criticized every mistake he made like his dreaded high school English teacher that made him read garbage he didn’t connect with or gave him nicknames like ‘muddle brain’ for mixings up words, reading backwards and seeing things in the stories she claimed weren’t there. They were. She just lacked imagination and perspective.  \n\nIt was her voice—teeth grinding on wool—that squelched through his mind to undermine his dignity and confidence as a thinking human being.   \n\nJake was convinced his teacher had existed solely to prevent those with other ideas and perspectives from ever pursing a literary career. His father didn’t care about his issue with his English teacher or with teachers in general.  \n\nIt didn’t matter.  \n\nStories didn’t matter.  \n\nJust tell the teacher what she wants to hear. Think of her as your boss and think of grades as money. Parrot her ideas and opinions and you’ll be rewarded with lots of money… maybe even a bonus or a promotion.   \n\nEasy enough advice to follow.  \n\nAnd yet his father’s advice did nothing to improve his sense of otherness in relation to the stories and curriculum he was subjected to on an almost daily basis. He still felt like an outsider for lacking interest in the literature and history he was expected to read and memorize as truths undeniable. Seemed like there was a big chunk of perspective missing from the overall narrative being poured into him like concrete that made him feel like he didn’t belong.  \n\nBut what does it matter now?  \n\nIt doesn’t.  \n\nLeave the past in the past and focus on what needs to get done.  \n\nI’m trying.  \n\nListen here, big brother… the sun’s coming down, you’re having conversations with yourself, and your cells are about to cannibalize one another. Find your focus."

He needs something… anything… and he regrets not taking the free granola bars from the clerk at the hunting store. He still doesn’t understand what he was trying to prove and to whom he was trying to prove it to. I guess I want to see if I could be like him.  \n\nYou’ve brought trail mix and other snacks before. What’s so special this time?  \n\nJake draws a deep, anxious breath. I don’t know…  \n\nThe hawk sails through the darkening sky, then swoops and quickly disappears near the stream. Jake stares after it for a long moment, then decides. He grabs his spear, staggers to his feet and stealthily makes his way toward the shimmering water.  \n\nBy a fallen tree he sees the hawk picking at feathers and bones. He inches closer, lifts his spear and launches it. The spear hits the ground, and the hawk rockets to the sky, leaving scraps behind. Scraps… Scraps will do. For now.  \n\nJake kneels by a sticky clump of flesh and feathers. He smells the pungent odor of heart-pounding red. He touches the sticky innards and the plucked skin and the bones… bones as white as the hog’s grin.  \n\nJake sighs his frustration and shakes his head. He doesn’t know if hogs display any kind of emotion. But if they can… this hog is definitely smiling. No… Not smiling… Laughing. \n\nWhat kind of bird is this, anyway?  \n\nDoesn’t matter. Jake pulls out matches and cooks the guts, preparing a kind of bird-pudding.  \n\nYou brought matches but no granola bars?  \n\nI don’t know what I was thinking.  \n\nYou’re not him, Jake.  \n\nI know.  \n\nHe died out there. \n\nHe disappeared.  \n\nSame thing.  \n\nNot to me.

He can’t even begin to imagine what it would be like to guide and care for others in the middle of nowhere. How’d he do it? How’d he feed them? How’d he lead them out of the woods with soldiers tracking them?  \n\nJake stops suddenly to examine a few broken twigs. He brings his focus back to the hunt, trying to determine which direction the hog took. Then he hears it.  \n\nSnorting.  \n\nAlmost inaudible, but he hears it. He turns toward a patch of shuffling high grass and narrows his gaze. The snorting grows louder and louder. He’s laughing at me! Sunnava bitch, is laughing at me!  \n\nYou aren’t worthy, kid!  \n\nThe hell I’m not!  \n\nJake launches his spear into the moving grass. A high pitch squeal follows, and the hog jolts away!  \n\nJake surges after him, tracking a trail of red to the mouth of a small cave. He laughs to himself and knows he will feast tonight. He’s done!   \n\nSo sure?  \n\nI searched that cave before… there’s no other way out. It’s just a matter of time and patience.   \n\nAnd focus… Jake… focus…  "

He helped so many people survive exposure, exhaustion and starvation. He saved them all and yet… he couldn’t save himself.  \n\nThey said there was a kind of smoke, too… a thick black smoke that suddenly surrounded them. One minute he was there. The next… he was gone.

And blinks, again. Truth is I let you catch me cause I figured you chased me long enough. Jake shakes his head in disbelief, and he knows his mind is still playing tricks on him despite having eaten. The hog sighs sadly. You and I, Jake, we’re caught in the same vicious cycle so don’t feel so bad, all right? Today it’s me. Tomorrow it’s you.  \n\nJake pinches himself but the hog continues. Chase something long enough and it will surrender itself to you. It will stop running and let you catch it so long as you stay the course. Just like that story you chased in the old country. Jake narrows his gaze on the grinning hog. Now you’re here on Blood Mountain trying to be your grandfather while trying to forget your father without realizing you’re both and neither of them at the same time.  \n\nJake tries to shake the hallucination out of his head. Don’t worry, Jake, I’m not really talking… you’re tired and dehydrated… and completely lost in the woods. I’m just trying to give you some perspective or rather… you’re trying to give yourself some perspective.  \n\nJake sighs deeply. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do and I’m talking to a dead hog in the middle of nowhere. The hog nods. Yes, you are. It’s interesting because your grandfather was poor and didn’t have many options and you’re not so poor and have too many options… I’m not sure which is worse… the tyranny of too little or the tyranny of too much… either way… a distracted life is a wasted life…  \n\nIt’s good that you came out here to figure things out. And you know what else is good? If you let go… if you just let go…  \n\nI have let go and I’m still as lost as I ever was.  \n\nThe hog snorts. You haven’t let go, Jake. You’re still playing the old scripts over and over again like a broken record. But let’s see… you like chasing stories… especially the hidden ones… you talk to yourself constantly… and you like being alone… maybe you’re a writer, Jake. Or maybe you’re a historian. \n\nJake laughs out loud. Are you kidding me! I hate history, and I failed every English class in high school cause I thought the rules were stupid and the teachers were boring.  \n\nYou and every other writer that actually made a dent. English class doesn’t make a writer, Jake… Fighting class and dancing class do.   \n\nI don’t even know what that means!  \n\nIt means you need guts and style, not grades and diplomas. It means you need courage and not the validation of some coward that doesn’t know what it’s like to lead someone on a dancefloor or step into a ring. It means your country needs a lot more stories like yours. Because let’s face it, Jake, if your story isn’t in the main narrative… if you’re just a footnote in a history book… you may as well not exist.  \n\nYou’re not your grandfather, Jake. You’re not your father either. And every generation has its challenge. Oppression. War. Separation. Maybe the challenge of your generation is… representation. You gotta get your stories out there whether you’re a writer, historian, filmmaker or producer. Seems to me a lot of kids like you in the new country need to hear your story or stories like yours to know they aren’t alone. To know they belong and that they aren’t outsiders in their own home.  \n\nA chorus of howls brings Jake back to the moment. Wolves! And they’re coming for what’s mine! They howl again, and above the racquet he hears his father’s voice. In every transaction, Jake, there are wolves.  \n\nNot in this one.  \n\nEspecially this one.  \n\nJake ignores the voice in his head and tries to focus as he considers his next move carefully. "

He feels his focus sharpening, and yet he still hears his mother. \n\nYou should have finished the letter when you had a chance.  \n\nI’ll finish it another time.  \n\nIf you get ‘another time’ Jake.  \n\nI will.  \n\nAnd what If you die here? What if you go missing? Your father will sell everything just to find you.  \n\nYeah, right. All he cares about is his packaging empire.   \n\nYou really don’t know your father if that’s what you think… or why he carries that picture with him everywhere he goes. \n\nJake scoffs. The picture means nothing! Even the fortune-teller didn’t know what it meant.  \n\nBut it means something to him, Jake. It means the world to him. You point your finger at your father and accuse him of not understanding you… but did you ever try to understand him?  \n\nSeveral wolves approach the tree and peer up at Jake with eyes that reflect the shining full moon. Jake tries to silence the voice and reign his focus on the threat at hand. But the voice—the voice of family—refuses to be silenced. \n\nLet me tell you something about your father, Jake… If he could give all his money away for just one chance to meet his father, he would. And… if you disappear because you were too pig-headed to let go… he’d drop everything just to find you. We all would.  \n\nLet go, Jake, and the wolves will disappear.  "

Jake holds the cord tightly with one hand as he uses the other hand to attack the wolves with a branch. He’s exhausted and doesn’t know what to do. He feels like a tick beaten and battered by the rain… broken… beaten… defeated… Not by the hunt, or the wolves but the thoughts and emotions swarming in his head like a hive of anxious bees.  \n\nThe wolves circle the tree with cackles and growls that seem like laughter in the night. How the hell did I end up here? Up a tree fighting wolves in the middle of nowhere! And how the hell am I gonna get down? He hears his brother’s voice break through the din below.  \n\nThe stupid shit we do when we’re lost and alone, right bro?  \n\nJake swallows a growing lump in his throat and admits the truth for the first time in years. You’ve always seen right through me, little bro. God, I miss you. But you’re right… I am lost and I am alone… and I have no idea who I am or what I want to do with my life… and that fortune-teller was right… I didn’t know what to choose… so I chose nothing.  \n\nHis mother’s voice returns. No, Jake. He was wrong. You did choose something.  \n\nJake draws a deep shuddering breath and closes his eyes, remembering his first birthday as his mother had described it so many times.  \n\nHe’s dressed in his first red and blue Hanbok, sitting on a white blanket with all kinds of objects spread before him. Pens. Rice. Paint. Ink. Brushes. Money. His aunts, uncles and cousins encourage him to choose something with exaggerated baby-talk.  \n\nThe fortune-teller asks everyone to be quiet and says the object Jake picks first will be the driving motivation of his life. The birthday boy drags himself toward the objects… drags himself past the pen… past the rice and the cake… past the ink and the brushes… nothing seems to interest him. But then—\n\nHe spots something. His eyes go wide with excitement, and he charges toward—\n\nThe money!  \n\nYells! Screams! More baby-talk to encourage him to take the money! But— \n\nJake doesn’t take the money. He doesn’t even look at it. He surprises everyone by charging past the money with perfect focus and he only stops when he reaches a man kneeling in prayer. One-year-old Jake looks up at his father, smiles, and grabs his finger. His father smiles back at him, and his mother takes a picture— \n\nThe picture.  \n\nJake opens his eyes and now he hears his mother’s voice above the snapping and snarling wolves. The fortune-teller didn’t really know what to tell us. He said we didn’t arrange the objects properly. He said you chose nothing. But I think we both know he was wrong.   \n\nI don’t understand… \n\nIt’s been years, Jake. Finish the letter. Teach him about his father. And come back home.   \n\nI wouldn’t know what to write… what to say… \n\nYou’ll figure it out. Just remember that he respects what you did because in the end he knows…  \n\nYou chose family.  \n\nYou always did, and you always will. That’s why I know you’ll do what needs to be done. Come back… help him complete his story.  \n\nThe imaginary words strike Jake’s heart like lightning. His eyes widen with sudden understanding, and for the first time in his life he wonders… he wonders what it would have been like to grow up without a father. To miss all the things his father gave him. To miss all the things he took for granted… \n\nHiking. Fishing. Hunting. Camping. Fun and fierce games of Baduk in moonlit tents. It wasn’t all superficial bullshit. There was good, too. A lot of good.  \n\nHe was so contradictory.  \n\nAren’t we all. \n\nI suppose we are.  \n\nJake loosens his grip on the cord and stares at the frenzied wolves below, and for the first time in his life, he knows exactly what he needs to do.

Sharp pain and dull discomfort as he rolls through broken glass, cigarette butts, and half-eaten corndogs. This is the last time you invade my trash! The raccoon twists, snaps at air until finding a fat chunk of flesh. Ah, damnit! Jeffrey loses his grip, recovers just in time to grab a bushy tail. He’s on the defensive; swings the animal around, whirling it like a lasso. He loses his grip. The raccoon soars through the air, reaching incredible heights. The squealing, thrashing silhouette of the woodland creature flies over the backdrop of a full moon. Majestic. It arcs downwards and… lands safely in a tree. Blast it all to hell! With a furious hiss, the raccoon scurries into the foliage and disappears. Scram, ya hairball… touch my garbage again and I’ll make a balloon animal outta your intestines. He wipes a smear of blood onto his pants. A blaring of trumpets rings through the night, coming from the circus tent in the distance. The acrobats are taking the stage!

But nothing compares to the splat. The splat makes it all worth it. Like a ripe tomato thrown against a wall. And then, silence. A hundred people in shock. Trauma forming in their brains. Future nightmares being scripted. The moment broken by a single woman’s scream, followed by a hundred more. Jeffrey can’t hold it any longer. He bellows laughter, nearly suffocates with glee. No one can hear over the turmoil. Half the crowd rushes to the exit, needing air, needing to be sick, needing a stiff drink. What a show! Jeffrey chuckles, wipes his tears, and then—oh my. His eyes glaze over. So many fingers pass by. Hundreds of them. He’s a kid in a candy shop, and the possibilities are measured by the handful. "

With considerable effort the memory arises: a first-grade teacher with a similar finger who used to wear cheap rings. He was a brat but she was too hard on him. A burst of endorphins tickles his spine. How would he immortalize this stand-in for his first-grade teacher? A sharpened pencil to her jugular? Stupid. Obvious. Pandering to irony.

All he sees is the finger… and the puddle at Moustache’s feet. Jeffrey knows what it means. The man's realized he has one chance at survival, and his fight or flight just kicked in. But Jeffrey doesn’t care, he knows he’s already won. The Finger of Chaos is as good as his. The memories of his father are already shifting. A large, horrible man towering above, bellowing—no, that isn’t it. Think, Jeffrey. A weak, slouching alcoholic, stammering and slurring, too pathetic to control him. The outburts? Nothing but the fury of a coward, the parody of a powerful man—a joke!<br><br>Moustache jumps up, reaches for the bottles of chemicals on the counter. Predictable. Jeffrey bellows laughter as he grabs the man’s neck and slams him to the floor. Puts his full weight onto Moustache, grips his throat and squeezes. You want to play with chemicals, do ya? I don’t even know what'd happen if those mixed. Hallucinations… euphoria… uncontrolled flatulence… death? Jeffrey thinks this over as he repeatedly smacks Moustache’s head into the floor. They all sound like hilarious endings. And why not add some uncertainty to the mix? He doesn’t need to fear chaos anymore. He can handle it. And hell, he deserves a little fun.<br><br>You want to play one last game? Okay, Moustache… let’s play. "

                  "SourceString": "The series featuring Haddie and Jordan on Terra 717 or Haley and Jaden on Terra 1315, or even Hannah and Justin on Terra 238 are all titled ‘HarbingerFM’ instead of ‘The Harbinger of Hell,’ and they seem to have more insight on what The Entity might be and how it corrupts and influences other worlds. Other Terra Worlds have quite unique and sometimes contradictory versions of the Harbinger series which make them difficult to track and interpret. But despite the discrepancies, each version seems to feature siblings trying to expose a nefarious cult devoted to The Entity.  \n\nI am currently searching the rift for the real memories that inspired all these adventures to see how close they are to the actual inspiration. I’m even wondering if Haddie and Jordan are here, trapped in The Entity, and, if they are, I’m hoping their memories will somehow help me find a way out of here. So far, I have found nothing close to a real memory, but I did find another story from Terra 717 in which Haddie discusses a phenomenon she calls ‘The Overlap’ and which other stories call The Borro, The Coil, The Bleed, etc.  \n\nI’m currently keeping extensive notes on the Harbinger stories and their descriptions of The Overlap to see if any of them can give me insight into what this phenomenon actually is. What I’ve discovered so far is that almost all of these stories describe places where a dark dimension intersects with the world and that these intersections seem to attract tragedy and misfortune. Some of these stories go so far as to claim ‘broken’ or ‘traumatized’ people can derive strange abilities from the vibrations emanating from these dark and ‘cursed’ places. These people can ultimately use The Bleed—my preferred name for the phenomenon—to access knowledge beyond the veil as it were.  \n\nThe Harbinger series from Terra 719 is also worth noting because the details included by the author seem closest to what we studied back home concerning Ancients and living dimensions, not to mention what I’ve been able to discover by examining the memories of souls marooned here. Piece by piece, or rather, story by story, I’m getting closer to salvation… or insanity… whichever comes first.  "

He stopped chewing his early morning, scrambled eggs and asked, “What’s this supposed to be?”  \n\n“I know who our mysterious benefactor is!” Haddie opened the envelope and pulled out a picture of a middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair in a dark suit.  \n\nJordan shrugged. “Who am I looking at?” \n\n“Surin Rivera. He was a sound engineer for a highly classified military project in the Office of Strategic Operations. He experienced a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized for years until he was released under the care of billionaire, philanthropist Kobe Dax. Others in the same program experienced similar breakdowns. One lives close by. The question is… why is Surin helping us?”  \n\nJordan raised his finger and pointed to a man standing behind Haddie. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Haddie turned to face the man in the picture standing beside her.  \n\nSurin took a seat beside Jordan and said, “You need to leave my case alone. I assure you both… You’re not ready for what you’re prying into.”  \n\n“And what is that?” Haddie questioned.  \n\nJordan took a small, nervous bite of his eggs and chewed slowly. “Let’s not provoke the man, sis. If we’re not ready… we’re not ready… I’m good with that.”  \n\n“How do you know our uncle?” Haddie asked when he didn’t answer her question. “Why are you helping us? What are these places you’re sending us to?”  \n\nSurin peered at Haddie for a long moment. Then he said, “Let’s just say I have a fond interest in your work and your special abilities.”  \n\nJordan swallowed and shrugged. “Okay… sure… that’s good enough for me.”  \n\n“Not me.” Haddie’s face hardened as she waited for an answer. “I want to know why your helping us.”  \n\nSurin scanned the deli nervously, then turned back to Haddie and Jordan. “Take my advice and don’t go down this rabbit hole. Not yet. You’re not ready, and you’re exposing yourself to dangerous people.”  \n\n“What kind of people?” Haddie narrowed her gaze on him. “Police? Military? What are we talking about here?”  \n\nSurin shook his head gravely. “We’re talking about people who don’t answer to the police or military. People who create governments and corporations to use to their end and then throw them away like garbage when they’re done.”  \n\n“What do they want?” Haddie asked, unsatisfied with his answer.  \n\nSurin stood. “Leave my case alone. Focus on the show and the leads I send your way. All will be revealed in due time.” \n\nHaddie held up the envelope with his picture. “I’m getting ahead of myself… is that it?” \n\n“Leave my case alone,” Surin repeated and walked away.  \n\nHaddie and Jordan watched Surin exit the deli in silence. Then Jordan turned to see Haddie’s determined expression, and he knew they weren’t leaving anything alone.  "

                  "SourceString": "“Come on, bro! Let’s get ahead of ourselves!” Haddie led Jordan to the entrance of a dilapidated house in the suburbs. “Colonel Jim Dunn worked with Surin Rivera in the OSO.” Before Haddie could say another word the door creaked open, revealing a plump, middle-age woman with short blond hair.  \n\n“Can I help you?” \n\nHaddie smiled. “Yes. I was actually hoping to speak to Col Lt Dunn for our podcast.”  \n\nThe woman took a step back. “Is this some kind of a prank?”  \n\nHaddie shook her head. “No, ma’am.” \n\n“Jim disappeared seven years ago. No one has any answers for me, and all I’m left with are rumors.” \n\nJordan inched closer to the woman. “Maybe our podcast could help? Maybe someone out there can help you if you share his story.”  \n\n“Share his story?” The woman hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded and said, “Yeah… all right… I just want my Jim back.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan entered the home and followed her to the kitchen where they sat around a small, round table.  \n\n“I can only tell you what Jim told me,” the woman said, taking a deep breath and releasing it slowly to calm her nerves. “He worked for the Office of Strategic Operations which was… I guess you could say… the stuff of conspiracy theories.”  \n\nShe paused, then continued. “Did you know Jim said the word ‘conspiracy theory’ used to never exist until the military created the term? Once you could actually question the government’s narrative but now… you’re not questioning anything because you don’t want to be called a ‘conspiracy theorist.’” \n\nThe woman laughed, then added, “Brilliant, really, and that’s pretty much why no one questions the government anymore… even if you’ve got a dozen whistleblowers with leaked documents all saying the same thing… you don’t really doubt or question anything cause you don’t want to be stigmatized.” \n\nThe woman shook her head in disbelief and continued with a little laugh. “Jim used to say the origin of ‘conspiracy theory’ is a conspiracy theory… anyway… he told me… there were places in the world that weren’t like other places… places which defied the laws of physics… which defied human comprehension… places connected to worlds away… to other dimensions… the government called it The Overlap. Crazy stuff, right? ” \n\nJordan nodded.  \n\nHaddie didn’t respond. She had heard the term before when they were investigating a mysterious cult that believed in a kind of ancient deity that would one day help humanity evolve to another plane of existence. It’s a strange coincidence that this cult and the government would have the same name for the phenomenon.  \n\n“Like a wormhole?” Jordan questioned.  \n\nThe woman shook her head. “That’s not how Jim described it. He didn’t talk much about The Overlap but he said what they had seen made him think another world was… how did he put it… consuming ours… like these Overlaps were growing bigger and bigger as we went down a kind of celestial digestive track… and… he said… he said they were pulling stuff out… things from other worlds….”  \n\nThe woman fell silent and thoughtful for a long moment. “I could see changes in him. He was getting angrier and mean and he was never mean. He stopped sharing things with me. And I started hearing rumors.” \n\n“What kind of rumors?” Haddie asked, leaning forward.  \n\nThe woman went silent and thoughtful. Then she said, “Rumors that the government was doing things to them so they could stay in The Overlap for longer periods of time. I even heard that they pulled someone out from another world. Imagine that… a person from another world or dimension.” \n\nTears filled her eyes. “They say he left me… but I know my Jim… something happened to him and the authorities dismiss me as conspiracy theorist for saying otherwise. But I’ll tell you this—” \n\nA sudden report and the woman’s mouth filled with thick, warm blood as she tried to speak. Shattered teeth and saliva gushed out instead of words. Then her eye went wide and she slumped forward.  \n\nJordan cursed and instantly tackled Haddie to the ground as bullets began to rip through the house from every direction.  \n\nHaddie stared up at her brother as bullets flew over their heads like angry wasps. “I think… we got ahead of ourselves.” \n\n“You think!”  "

They stumbled down the stairs into the darkness and through a beam of sunlight pouring through a rectangular window. Before they could hide, the assassin was already descending the stairs with his rifle trained on them. Haddie and Jordan held hands and closed their eyes waiting for a quick death. A loud report sounded and when they opened their eyes they were both still standing.  \n\nThe assassin stared at them with big white eyes of disbelief, then he collapsed to reveal Surin holding a smoking revolver. “Come on,” he said. “We need to leave before others come.”  \n\nThe siblings didn’t hesitate, following Surin up the stairs and out the door past several dead bodies. Haddie counted seven dead assassins by the time she followed her brother into an unmarked black sedan. With a great sense of urgency, Surin started the engine, hit the accelerator and the car peeled away. After a silence, Haddie asked, “Is any of it true? The rumors? Worlds intersecting? The Overlap?”  \n\nSurin didn’t take his eyes off the road as he drove them back to the hotel where their uncle was waiting for them. “I can’t really answer that right now and you need to focus on your next episode. You’re here to investigate the old, abandoned subway station, and I think you should stick to the agenda.”  \n\n“Is it an Overlap?” Jordan asked. “Is that why there were so many accidents? Is that why it was abandoned?”   \n\nSurin hesitated, then nodded gravely.  \n\n“What do you and a billionaire care about the old, subway?” Haddie asked.  \n\nSurin sighed, took a moment to find his words, then answered. “I’m looking for my colleagues. We explored these areas all over the world and a few of us never returned and those that did… they came back to us… lost… confused… insane, even. I want answers. I want to know what happened to the others. I know they’re still alive. They’re lost somewhere… between worlds.”  \n\n“So you’re using us to find them?” Haddie said flatly.  \n\n“We’re helping each other in mutually beneficial ways.”  \n\nHaddie shook her head. “I need to know more. That’s not enough for me.”  \n\nSurin sighed and pulled the sedan over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine. After a long thoughtful moment, he looked at the siblings in the rear-view mirror and said, “I was undergoing some, let’s say, unorthodox training to enter The Overlap… but it wasn’t possible… it’s like an impossible energy that pulls… I don’t know… hell… pulls hell right out of you… I mean there’s no other way to describe it. What you feel is just pure darkness. But the OSO figured when the mind is developing it can be… it can be fractured… broken in ways so that it rewires itself to withstand the stress of The Overlap.” \n\n“You turned children into tools!” Jordan spat in disgust. \n\nSurin looked away from the rear-view mirror and lowered his gaze without answering.  \n\n“And so I’m your new tool,” Haddie said. There was a short silence as Haddie considered her last few investigations. She remembered finding journals in the old asylum that had notes about other realms. Memories of other people trapped in a deathless world and journal entries revealing thoughts about how artists and writers were able to somehow tune into these other worlds with what they believed was their imagination but what was actually their third eye. It was a strange theory that Haddie had dismissed as the ravings of a depraved lunatic with a wild imagination. But something the patient had written had stuck with her.  \n\nThe truth is in the story.   \n\nHaddie whispered the words to herself and thought she would give those notebooks another read in case she had missed something. She had them stored in her studio apartment in Montreal and would force Stefan to make a detour before their next investigation.  \n\n“You don’t understand,” Surin continued. “This isn’t just about the friends I lost… There are things in The Overlap we need to understand. There could be a new type of energy… a new way of seeing the world… the universe—”  \n\nJordan interrupted with a laugh. “Or… there’s nothing there… and it’s just a living hell.”  "

What we do know is generators at the power company exploded into violent flames taking down powerlines leaving the western sector of the city in the dark. City Police report these unknown creatures attacked several automobiles near the company and are considered extremely dangerous. At least three motorists are dead and four others are in critical condition. Motorists are urged to avoid roads near the power station and the 93 South. That’s the latest we have on the attacks.

The spokesperson for the Falls City General Hospital reports an unusual and alarming increase of poison cases due to an unknown spider the size of a fist with bright orange spiral-like markings on its back. The authorities are calling it the hell-back spider and advise you to stay at least two meters away from the spider should you come in contact with one. Federal officials say they are trying to cope with this situation and are still trying to determine if this is in fact a terrorist attack or another phenomenon known as ‘Spontaneous Evolution’ in which new species suddenly appear without any plausible scientific explanation. Other theories suggest a government experiment gone wrong as in the case of the weaponized ticks carrying the human-made Lyme disease variant that escaped from a classified biological warfare laboratory on Apricot Island. The situation seems to be reaching emergency proportions as more and more districts lose power. The city’s coroner’s office says dozens of corpses now reveal the poison from the hell-back spider to be slow and lethal as boils and puss slowly cover the body. There also seem to be indications that some victims go on murderous rampages induced by fever, overactive adrenal glands and what can only be described as a complete loss of sanity. Infected individuals are to be handled with extreme caution until the boils cover the entire body and movement becomes practically impossible. A representative of the Falls City Power Company says they are actively trying to fix the generators to restore electricity but a strange black fog is slowing down repair crews. Anonymous workers at the company are saying on social media that they are hearing strange sounds coming from the fog and believe it may somehow be linked to the spiders. One report claims a worker’s body burst open with spiders after she inhaled the fog. Another report says that before the initial attacks, carcasses of deer were found with thousands if not millions of spiders crawling out of them. I should repeat that… There is a fog and it seems to be carrying microscopic eggs that require a biological host… We advise people to stay calm and take extreme caution if they come in contact with the fog or a hell-back spider. We’ll get back to you with further developments. In the meantime back to Money-Bake brought to you by The Now-or-Never Management Firm… because today’s tragedy is tomorrow’s golden opportunity.  "

Spiders of unknown origin of all shapes and sizes seem to be advancing toward residential areas, but authorities are asking everyone to remain calm and that the military is on its way to contain the anomaly. There are reports of similar phenomena in other countries and cities around the world but they have yet to be confirmed. And now we are trying to get whatever information we possibly can to keep you up to speed. And wait… this… this is just in… we have news that a group of teens have barricaded themselves in an abandoned cannery by the docks and are live-streaming attacks from what are clearly spiders the size of dogs. Two of the teens are the sons of our producer Sabrina Malkas. Sabrina’s desperately trying to get in touch with her sons Elias and Elan but can’t… she seems to recognize their friends… Casey… Ariella… Olivia and… she believes… Nina… It seems as though Casey may have inhaled the fog we heard about earlier and is complaining about headaches and nausea… and things crawling under her skin… we’re currently trying to connect to their audio feed to get a better sense of what’s happening out there. Please stand by.  "

Elan and Elias confirm Olivia was bitten by a hell-back and has been locked in a room before she becomes a danger to everyone else. The live-feed shows that Casey is swelling all over her body especially in her neck where tiny things seem to be moving under the skin. Nina is missing and what we understand… what we are reading in the comments is… she was pulled outside by a spider and dragged away.
