But there was something about that ridiculous sketch that reminded me of a book I had seen when we first arrived at the tower. I can’t remember if I had seen the book in the library or the basement, but the word ‘sweet’ keeps coming back to me for some reason."

She didn’t answer, but the random comments seemed to have stopped. For now, anyway."
