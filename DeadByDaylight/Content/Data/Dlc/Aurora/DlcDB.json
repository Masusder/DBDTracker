For those who survive, they are left altered, futilely attempting to expunge their pain, forever bound to a past that can never be escaped.<br><br>Unite with The Twins, a pair of conjoined siblings who have suffered a life of persecution. When humanity tormented them for their condition, they had no choice but to draw blood. Now, empowered by The Entity, they have gained the ability to divide and share the hunt.<br><br>Fight back with Élodie Rakoto, a relic hunter who has spent her life searching for her missing parents. When her occult investigation came to a bloody end, she found herself transported to The Entity’s realm. Stubborn and cunning, she has ways to battle and outwit those who would stand in her way. "
