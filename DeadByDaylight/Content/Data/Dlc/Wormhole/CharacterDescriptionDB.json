The shuttle jolted and rattled and then there was silence as the Nostromo receded into nothingness. <br><br>Unhooking her straps, Ripley began to prepare for the long journey back to the frontier when suddenly something stirred in the deep shadows of the shuttle—\nThe alien. <br><br>Cautiously, Ripley inched toward the lockers where she put on her pressure suit. Then, as the alien advanced on her, she opened the airlock, ejecting the alien into the cold expanse of space. \nWith the shuttle secure, Ripley recorded her final report of the Commercial Starship Nostromo and proceeded to enter her hypersleep chamber.
