          "LocalizedString": "What does it mean to be authentic? How does one follow one’s destiny despite the pressures of family and tradition? Often following one‘s path is a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately it’s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization. But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good or bad, must be faced.\n\nHeir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust. As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims took revenge on him. It drew The Entity’s attention and he was deemed worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.\n\nQuick, daring and superstitious, Yui Kimura was one of the youngest motorcyclists to break records in unsanctioned street races as well as the very prestigious Moto Grand Prix of Japan. Breaking with tradition and against her parents’ wishes, she left her home to pursue her dreams of racing and led a gang helping women in troubled situations. Until she found herself roped into another endless race where crossing the finish line was a matter of life and death."
