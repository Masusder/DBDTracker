Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off.<br><br>For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of all those around him. After a terrible fight with a fully formed Kandarian demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>After his deal with a demon went South, Ash found himself in the realm of The Entity, without shotgun or chainsaw."
