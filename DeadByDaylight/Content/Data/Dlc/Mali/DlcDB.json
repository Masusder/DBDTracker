When surrounded by darkness, they look inward for a beacon of light to follow, trusting it will lead them to safety. But when their light is distorted by pride and ambition, how long will they err in the dark?<br><br>Sold to a Babylonian temple as a child, she sought the means to repel the darkness she carried inside. She found solace in sacred rituals, where she felt safe and empowered. Faithful but proud, she began to rise in status and believed she was untouchable. But when a plague began to defile her body, she confronted her gods, realizing too late that they had no impact on her fate.<br><br>Jane Romero was striving to become a powerful icon, a voice that would inspire and support those in need. She fought against powerful executives to send out her message about owning up to your insecurities. Her goal was to release people from the painful experiences that plagued their chances at a successful future. Every day she would share her beliefs and practices with thousands of avid followers. Adding to her success was the growing pressure from the media to fit the mold, and a difficult past that weighted on her shoulders, which made her question her legitimacy. One evening, she was driving home after a particularly stressful live show, and feeling drained, she closed her eyes for a moment that had lasting consequences."
