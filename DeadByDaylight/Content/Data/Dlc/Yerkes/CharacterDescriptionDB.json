However, he escaped death by having his soul possess a Good Guys doll named Chucky through a curse. \n\nChucky didn't want to stay a Good Guy forever, though, and he knew there was only one way to change that: take the body of Andy Barclay, the first person he had revealed his secret to. After his first attempt failed, Chucky waited two long years before he found Andy again. \n\nWith nobody standing between Chucky and Andy, he took the boy to the Good Guy factory to complete the process of stealing Andy’s body. But Andy’s foster sister, Kyle, realized something was amiss, and followed Andy to the factory.  \n\nInside the factory Chucky forced Andy to the ground and spoke ancient words to take possession of his body. But the ritual didn’t go as planned and Kyle quickly and desperately toppled a stack of Good Guy boxes over him.   \n\nChucky screamed his frustration as he pushed through the pile of boxes. Gathering his wits, he looked down the brightly lit aisle and saw Andy running into a thick, swirling mass of fog. He thought he was seeing things at first, but then he realized the fog was real and there to help him. His words hadn’t worked as intended but he had somehow conjured something else, something unexpected, something he didn’t quite understand. \n\nAnd not wanting to lose his only chance for a real body, he charged through the fog screaming after Andy."
