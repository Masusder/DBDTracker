And one day Andrew’s foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life. With no other option, Sally had to find a way but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. She started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift. Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Finally, she could not take it anymore and concepts of purification emerged inside her. As the morning staff arrived one day in September, they found over fifty patients dead in their beds, and four staff members, also dead. Only Sally had survived the night but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found."
