A new Map – the Shattered Square – is available for all players. Purchasing this add-on unlocks an exclusive Cosmetic for Vittorio: Handsome Riding Jacket.\n\nThe Killer is The Knight, whose loyal guards follow his commands with vicious cruelty. Boasting unrivalled martial prowess, his blade’s thirst has yet to be sated. His wrath fell upon the Shattered Square, leaving only destruction in his wake. Dead by Daylight: Forged In Fog also includes a new Survivor: Vittorio Toscano, a voyager from a lost age and willing wanderer of realms. The age of iron and stone is over – so begins an age of Fog, and those forged within it."
