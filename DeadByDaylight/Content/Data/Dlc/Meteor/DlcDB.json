A new map, the disturbing Garden of Joy, is available for all players. Purchasing this add-on also unlocks an exclusive outfit for Haddie: The Pale Piped Shirt.<br><br>The Killer is The Dredge. A formless mass of twisted limbs writhing in the shadows, The Dredge is a manifestation of repressed darkness. All light will drain in the presence of this unsettling abomination. Look no further than the once-idyllic Garden of Joy, left forever tainted by The Dredge’s gruesome appetite. Yet few stand bolder than Haddie Kaur. Fuelled by courage, determination, and a dash of morbid curiosity, this explorer of haunted corners leaves no stone unturned in her quest for eldritch understanding."
