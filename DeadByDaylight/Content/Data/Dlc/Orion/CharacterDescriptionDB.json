Believing himself the best test subject, he exposed himself to the Prototype virus. Now with superhuman strength, Wesker faked his death and went underground with a new plan: expose the world to Uroboros, a biological weapon that would eliminate the weak and leave only the strong. <br><br>\nWesker began to put his plan to action in Africa but was confronted by members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance at a hangar stocked with missiles carrying Uroboros. Determined to be at the vanguard of evolution, he once again made himself a test subject. Exposing himself to Uroboros, he began to evolve in ways he could have never imagined. But as he felt his cells change, a strange black fog seeped into the hangar and filled his vision. When the fog finally dissipated, he found himself in another world surrounded by lesser beings that deserved to be put out of their misery."
