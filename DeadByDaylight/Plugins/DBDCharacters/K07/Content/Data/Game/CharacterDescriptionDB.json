This is where Herman met Dr. Otto Stamper where under his guidance, Herman began to use strange and ever increasingly vicious methods to extract information from prisoners sent to the institute, which was also a covert prison and re-education center for whoever was the USA’s current nemesis. His liberal use of violent electroshock therapy revealed dramatic results and several threats to national security were uncovered.<br><br>Over the years, Herman became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their information. It was only after the Léry Memorial Institute went silent for a week that the true horror was finally discovered. The personnel, patients, and prisoners were all found dead with all types of head trauma. All personnel and prisoners' bodies were accounted for, including Dr. Otto Stamper, but no sign of Herman “The Doctor” Carter.<br>"
